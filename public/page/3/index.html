    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Yesterday we released CryptPad v1.9.0 Jackalope, we have some exciting new features
which we’ve been working on for a long time. As part of the
<a href="https://github.com/UCF-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UCF project</a> we have implemented a Zero Knowledge
<code>media-tag</code> in CryptPad for displaying and downloading encrypted files stored in
CryptPad. Starting now, you can upload files by clicking the upload button or
dragging them into your CryptDrive. You can also view pictures and PDF files in
CryptPad and you can drag-and-drop pictures <strong>directly</strong> into presentations. In the
next release we will hopefully be adding drag-and-drop pictures into the pad.</p>
<p><img src="/images/CryptPad_drive_with_upload.png" alt="CryptDrive Upload"></p>
<h2 id="Filenames"><a href="#Filenames" class="headerlink" title="Filenames"></a>Filenames</h2><p>We also made a significant but less visible improvement to the CryptDrive. When you
make a new pad in CryptPad, it has a <em>title</em>, which anyone in the pad can change, and
it has a <em>filename</em> which it how the pad is shown in your CryptDrive. Because anyone
at any time can change the <em>title</em> of a pad, the only way to know the titles of all
the pads in your drive is to load each and every one of them which would take a long
time. But the <em>filename</em> is your unique way to refer to a pad, it lives only in
<em>your</em> CryptDrive and it is the same no matter what <em>title</em> someone gives to the pad.</p>
<p>Now the CryptDrive UI shows only one name for a pad, this name is just the <em>title</em>
of the pad at the last time you’d accessed it <strong>unless</strong> you assign it your own
<em>filename</em>.</p>
<h2 id="Slide-Preview"><a href="#Slide-Preview" class="headerlink" title="Slide Preview"></a>Slide Preview</h2><p>When you’re using the CryptPad slide app to make a quick presentation, now you can
see your presentation in the righthand pane while you type. Since presentations are
written in Markdown, this means you get a live action preview of what your
presentation slides are going to look like.</p>

<hr>
<p>You ever wonder why Open Source software always seems to be slightly harder
to use and slightly buggier and slightly less <em>polished</em> than proprietary
competitors?</p>
<p>How about this: Why is it that good people who want to make good things somehow
end up making evil things for evil corporations which sell them to other good
people who would (presumably) rather buy good things.</p>
<h2 id="It’s-all-about-incentives"><a href="#It’s-all-about-incentives" class="headerlink" title="It’s all about incentives"></a>It’s all about incentives</h2><p>It’s hard to talk about incentives without sounding like a miserly tool, but if
we’re going to hack ourselves out of a situation that nobody really wants to be in,
we’re going to need to understand them pretty well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is Open Source habitually <em>90% of the way there</em> ?</li>
<li>Why is Facebook more addictive than it is useful ?</li>
<li>Why is it that when you get something for free, even from a well funded
government program, it’s reliably worse than something you buy?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all about incentives.</p>
<h3 id="In-a-restaurant-you’re-the-customer"><a href="#In-a-restaurant-you’re-the-customer" class="headerlink" title="In a restaurant, you’re the customer"></a>In a restaurant, you’re the customer</h3><p>I love going to restaurants. I have no car and few possessions so restaurants are
the way I spend my income. Not only do I love food but I love the relationship
which I have with restaurateurs. When I walk into a restaurant, I want to be fed
delicious food and they want to be paid, not only that, they want me to be happy
so I will return many times and bring my friends. I want them to be happy so they
will give me bigger portions and maybe a little dessert on the house. Our
incentives are aligned perfectly. We are practically a team.</p>
<h3 id="In-a-soup-kitchen-you’re-just-a-user"><a href="#In-a-soup-kitchen-you’re-just-a-user" class="headerlink" title="In a soup kitchen, you’re just a user"></a>In a soup kitchen, you’re just a user</h3><p>It is hard to deny the importance of soup kitchens to the fabric of society.
Part of what makes us able to claim to be civilized is the fact that we don’t let
people simply die if they’re down on their luck. Soup kitchens, however, are not
restaurants. When you walk into a soup kitchen, you are generally greeted kindly
but there is a subtle distinction from a restaurant, at a restaurant you’re the
customer and at a soup kitchen you’re just a <em>user</em>. Many soup kitchens are
organized around religious groups and  evangelizing their belief is a significant
part of their motivation, but even secular organizations are motivated by some
sort of a higher calling.</p>
<h3 id="Open-Source-is-a-soup-kitchen"><a href="#Open-Source-is-a-soup-kitchen" class="headerlink" title="Open Source is a soup kitchen"></a>Open Source is a soup kitchen</h3><p>I’ve been developing Open Source both professionally and personally for 7 years
and I’m going to tell you something that many Open Source developers won’t admit.
Open Source software is not made for you. Sometimes Open Source developers are
motivated by the Free Software ideology and they imagine their code as
transforming the world, sometimes they just want to solve some problem for
themselves and they give away the resulting code. Open Source software is almost
never developed for the simple purpose of making another person’s life a little
easier.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-aren’t-the-customer-you’re-the-product"><a href="#If-you-aren’t-the-customer-you’re-the-product" class="headerlink" title="If you aren’t the customer you’re the product"></a>If you aren’t the customer you’re the product</h2><p>This aphorism has become popular with the rise of ad-tech and social network
websites. The phrase invokes an image of free services coming like free grain
because you are, in fact, the pig on his way to slaughter. In some way this is
true, Silicon Valley business models are becoming disturbingly like human
farming.</p>
<p>However, the phrase also invokes an image of an evil entrepreneur plotting to
enslave humanity by creating a slick social network. If 1 in 1000 companies is
successful then logic implies there must be thousands of evil entrepreneurs
running around everywhere. If this is true then where are all of the failed
evil plotters? I’ve never met an entrepreneur who was anything less than an
aspiring saint.</p>
<p>I think the real reason why social networks become human farms is because people
don’t want to pay for development of web services and stuck between a successful
human farm and a failing soup kitchen, entrepreneurs begrudgingly choose to farm.</p>
<h2 id="Breaking-out"><a href="#Breaking-out" class="headerlink" title="Breaking out"></a>Breaking out</h2><p>If we’re ever going to stop living in a world of farms and soup kitchens, we’re
going to need to get serious about incentives. Part of my intention in starting
the CryptPad project is to build something that is not a farm nor a soup kitchen.
I want to have a mutually beneficial relationship with every one of CryptPad’s
users, including you. I don’t want to be a charity worker beholden to an NGO or
a post office clerk drawing a paycheck from the state. I want you to be my boss,
I want to obsess about making your life better, I want fair exchange of value
and aligned incentives.</p>
<h2 id="Changes-in-CryptPad"><a href="#Changes-in-CryptPad" class="headerlink" title="Changes in CryptPad"></a>Changes in CryptPad</h2><p><a href="/2017/05/23/CryptPad-use-it-love-it-support-it/">As you may already know</a>,
cryptpad.fr now limits your data storage and allows you to buy an account which
will raise that limit. The code for limits and accounts is also in the CryptPad
codebase and turned on by default. If you are installing CryptPad, you have
three choices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Leave it exactly as it is: People will be limited to 50MB of storage and they
will see a <em>Support CryptPad</em> button. In the development time this donated money
buys, we will pay special consideration to the needs of CryptPad admins like you.</li>
<li>Share the revenue: If you specify some configuration parameters and send us
an <a href="mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email</a>, the donation button will become an
<em>Upgrade Account</em> button, allowing them to take a plan with additional storage
quota. When people upgrade their account on your server, we will credit you 50%
of the revenue earned. This helps us pay the cost of development and helps you
pay the cost of hosting.</li>
<li>Disable the donate button: If you do this, we hope you will help CryptPad in
some other way such as by taking an on-premises support contract.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you run a public CryptPad instance, please don’t increase the 50MB per user
storage limit. This limit is what makes people subscribe and what pays for
CryptPad development. Running a CryptPad instance which offers a “better deal”
is effectively using the project against itself.</p>
<p>Finally, new versions of CryptPad always check for new or expired accounts from
our account server. We have added a parameter called <em>adminEmail</em> which will be
sent along with the domain and version of CryptPad you’re running. This way we
can notify you if we’re aware of any a serious problems with your CryptPad
instance. We take your privacy seriously and will never sell your email or send
you marketing spam. If, however, you want to keep your CryptPad instance
completely  hidden from us, you can set this parameter to <strong>false</strong> and it will
never query the account server.</p>
<h2 id="Coming-next"><a href="#Coming-next" class="headerlink" title="Coming next"></a>Coming next</h2><p>Our objective is to help you collaborate, stay organized and get things done
faster and easier. We want to provide maximum value to you and we want you to
provide value to us so that we can continue doing it. As was said in the
previous post, the big issues which we are planning to tackle soon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>File upload for PDF and image embedding</li>
<li>Text coloring based on the authors of the document</li>
<li>Workgroups for team collaboration</li>
<li>Zero Knowledge spreadsheets</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, we will be continuing to put great effort into understanding your
problems, how you go about solving them, and how we can make little changes to
make CryptPad fit your needs better.</p>
<p>Caleb</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>It’s been another release day in our little team. Today we released
<a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptPad v1.7.0 (Hodag)</a>. The biggest new feature in this version is that when you create a <em>/code/</em> pad, the default highlighting is in markdown syntax and there it is rendered in realtime while you type. Try it out by making a pad at <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/code" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptpad.fr/code</a>.</p>
<p>In this release we also completed something much more important and central to the future of CryptPad. We finished our first version of the payment server which allows you to take a subscription and help support the work that we do.</p>
<p>Starting with this release we are now imposing a 50MB storage limit for our anonymous users and a 3 month expiration of pads which are not stored by a registered user. </p>
<p>Instant collaboration is the vision of CryptPad and we are committed to continuing to provide that and even providing 50MB of persistent storage for anyone who is willing to sign up.</p>
<p>For people who are ready to take the next step, we are now providing subscriptions which will improve how you organize your information while helping CryptPad to grow and improve.</p>
<h2 id="Plans"><a href="#Plans" class="headerlink" title="Plans"></a>Plans</h2><ol>
<li>Personal (5GB storage, 5€/month ex. VAT)<ul>
<li>This is best for an individual using lots of pads for collaboration and note taking. For the price of a sandwich you can stay organized on all of your devices while also keeping your privacy private.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Standard (20GB storage, 10€/month ex. VAT)<ul>
<li>For the price of lunch, you can have 20GB of storage, enough for not only pads but also for the soon to launch File Upload which will allow Zero Knowledge storage of files such as pictures and PDF documents. With the Standard plan you can add one more friend for free.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Team (50GB storage, 15€/month ex. VAT)<ul>
<li>If you’re ready to extend your usage of CryptPad to an entire team, we are ready to help you succeed. With a Team plan you get 50GB of data storage in CryptPad, plenty for files and pads. You also get to add <strong>five</strong> people to your plan and you get professional support available in English and French.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal is to make the best collaboration tool available while still being unable to sell or leak your content. Help us succeed, helping you stay organized and help show the world that Zero Knowledge Cloud is possible.</p>
<h2 id="For-Admins"><a href="#For-Admins" class="headerlink" title="For Admins"></a>For Admins</h2><p>If you’re hosting your own instance of CryptPad, there are a few things you’ll need to do when you upgrade to Hodag. The limits code is still somewhat of a mess and while we get it tied down, you’ll need to do a bit of work to disable it.</p>
<p>First there is a serverside per-user storage limit defined in <code>config.js</code> You’ll want to set this to a big number like so:</p>
<pre><code>defaultStorageLimit: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER
</code></pre><p>Then there is <code>customize/application_config.js</code>. If you’re not familiar with <code>/customize/</code>, you can create this directory and then copy <code>application_config.js</code> over from the <code>/customize.dist/</code> directory so it will not be overwritten. The server will try looking in <code>/customize/</code> first.</p>
<p>Inside of <code>application_config.js</code> you’ll need to update the <code>enablePinLimit</code> line like so:</p>
<pre><code>enablePinLimit = false;
</code></pre><p>If you’re using your own CryptPad installation in a business context, please consider contacting <a href="mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales@cryptpad.fr</a> for an on-premises support contract. You’ll get help with upgrades and early information about security issues.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-Next"><a href="#What’s-Next" class="headerlink" title="What’s Next"></a>What’s Next</h2><p>In the coming months, we’re hoping to roll out text coloring based on the authors of the document as well as file upload for PDF and image embedding. Eventually we plan to add Zero Knowledge spreadsheets and workgroups for team collaboration.</p>

        <p>It’s been two and a half years since the <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/commit/1508c7ba71f5de5e51f061fbef45bc1f18493832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first commit to CryptPad</a>,
we no longer have the hideous white and green color-scheme and we’re on our third URL format.
More importantly we now have a CryptDrive with folders instead of just remembering a few recent
pads in the browser’s local storage.</p>
<p>The success of CryptPad as a tool for organizing and collaboration makes us glad to be working on
the technology, but our desire to avoid collecting metadata has lead to an unsustainable situation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We can’t store data we don’t understand for people we don’t know</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There has been a proliferation of pads which are not accessed after a while and we don’t know who
made them or even what type of pad they are. We know that a great many of them are “test pads”,
if for no other reason, because we made a lot of them. Eventually we will be forced to delete old
data but we don’t want to delete anything important.</p>
<p>Starting a few weeks ago we implemented a system called pinning. When you are logged in, your
browser tells CryptPad all of the things in your drive. We don’t know what’s in them but we know
they’re important so we shouldn’t delete them. Right now you can log in to CryptPad, go to your
<a href="https://cryptpad.fr/settings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Settings Page</a> and click the <strong>Usage</strong> button to see how much data
you are pinning.</p>
<p>We recognize many users of CryptPad would like to use it anonymously and we will continue to support
anonymous pads, but soon they will begin to be removed from storage after 3 months of inactivity.
We’ve also simplified the anonymous CryptDrive because we want to send the message loud and clear
that <em>pads in the anonymous drive are not safe from deletion</em>.</p>
<p>So please register and log in, you’ll get 50MB of pinning quota with the full features of CryptDrive
and you can be sure that none of your pads will ever be removed from the server.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>CryptPad started as a novel idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>provide a means for people to collaborate on the web, without their data being exposed to the server that connects them</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since its conception as one developer’s hobby project, this idea has grown organically into a team of core developers, a community of contributors, and a growing number of people who collaborate with CryptPad every day.</p>
<h2 id="How-we’re-able-to-do-this-work"><a href="#How-we’re-able-to-do-this-work" class="headerlink" title="How we’re able to do this work"></a>How we’re able to do this work</h2><p>CryptPad is a part of the OpenPaaS-NG project, which is funded by <a href="http://www.bpifrance.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPIFrance</a>.
As mentioned in <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/04/01/Exciting-news/">our April 1st post</a>, this funding only applies to 50% of our expenses.
I joked that the other 50% was being covered by our new partners (the <em><strong>NSA</strong></em>), but in fact, the remainder is still covered entirely by <a href="http://xwiki.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XWiki SAS</a>.</p>
<p>We have a fair amount of autonomy when it comes to deciding what features we will develop.
With that in mind, however, there are some long term goals that come as a part of OpenPaaS, some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.</p>
<p>We recognize that however people’s goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.</p>
<p>By operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we’re able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.
Our ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://open-paas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenPaaS-NG project</a> is only funded until 2019, we’ve been searching for other means of funding.
Until 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.
We hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.</p>
<h2 id="Our-new-funding-strategies"><a href="#Our-new-funding-strategies" class="headerlink" title="Our new funding strategies"></a>Our new funding strategies</h2><p>Many of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.
They offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.</p>
<p>We’ve chosen not to pursue either of these options.
Instead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we’re doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.
We’re willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are <em>willing to pay not to be a product themselves</em>.</p>
<p>To be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.
Anybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.
Additionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.
Going forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.</p>
<h3 id="Paid-hosting"><a href="#Paid-hosting" class="headerlink" title="Paid hosting"></a>Paid hosting</h3><p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptPad.fr</a> hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.
So far, this hasn’t been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won’t be something that we can sustain.</p>
<p>In many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.
In other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.
At some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.</p>
<p>To address this problem, we’ve implemented <strong>pinning</strong>, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.
Anonymous pads, that is, <em>those which aren’t pinned by a registered user</em>, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.
We believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pinning will only be available to registered users.</li>
<li>Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017</li>
<li>Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.<ul>
<li>new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive</li>
<li>removing a file from your drive’s trash will unpin it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed<ul>
<li>effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.</li>
<li>For additional storage, you’ll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.</li>
<li>We’ll have more information about pricing soon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Support-contracts-for-private-installations"><a href="#Support-contracts-for-private-installations" class="headerlink" title="Support contracts for private installations"></a>Support contracts for private installations</h3><p>If you’ve decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.
Like you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.</p>
<p>If you’re using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.
We’re still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki’s many customers in the past.
You can see an example of XWiki’s pricing <a href="http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.
Otherwise, if you find that you’re comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you’d like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we’ll be there to help.</p>
<h3 id="Sponsored-development-of-open-source-features"><a href="#Sponsored-development-of-open-source-features" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored development of open source features"></a>Sponsored development of open source features</h3><p>If there’s a particular feature you’d like to see implemented within CryptPad, we’re able to dedicate development time to build it into the software in the best way possible.</p>
<p>Sponsored development allows us to build features to suit particular users’ needs.
By integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.
This helps us refine those features to be even more useful for you, and ensures that they will continue to be supported well into the future.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-next"><a href="#What’s-next" class="headerlink" title="What’s next"></a>What’s next</h2><p>Since we announced our <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/">bi-weekly release schedule</a>, we’ve tried to make sure that each release contains an exciting feature.
This time around, we’ve had to set some time aside to implement pinning, as well as code for reporting the size used by any one user’s drive.
We realize this isn’t especially interesting for most of you, but it will be necessary for some more advanced features which we hope to share with you soon.</p>
<p>By providing a quota system for our registered users, we will be able to offer encrypted file upload capabilities.
You’ll be able to upload images, and embed them in presentations and pads, a process which has been somewhat difficult so far.
Our decision to limit users’ upload capacity is intended less to make a profit, and more to limit abuse.</p>
<p>We recognize that disk space is getting cheaper all the time, and that cloud hosting services will be able to offer more competitive pricing.
Our aim isn’t to compete with the giants in the cloud industry, but simply to finance our ongoing research into privacy-friendly collaboration.
There is still much to do, but working together, we can accomplish great things.</p>

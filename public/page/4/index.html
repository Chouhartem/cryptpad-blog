<p>The beginning of the year has been busy.
We <a href="/2019/02/22/Heading-to-Barcelona/">traveled to Barcelona</a> to officially receive our NGI Award.
Spreadsheet functionality was officially released in CryptPad and our funding has been progressing since <a href="/2018/12/09/CryptPad-funding-status-November-2018/">our last status in November</a>.</p>
<p>We have seen a spike of both new subscriptions and growing usage of <a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptPad.fr</a> in the last few months.
You can see the numbers in <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/ppScrSTQQy7gQ6gwYG2pSvNzedP0mHhhFHWwPl5P+Vk/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new spreadsheet function launched in January</a> (though this functionality is still restricted to registered users).</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-funding.png?v=2" alt="CryptPad funding details"></p>
<p>We now have more than 100 backers from 23 countries around the world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-funding-countries.png" alt="CryptPad funding by country"></p>
<p>While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing.
We will reach a first goal of 6k by the end of the OpenPaaS-NG project ending this month.
We have also candidated to the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2019/20190201-call.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NLNet Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technology funding call</a>. </p>
<p>Now we need more help!
First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space.
Proprietary software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding.
If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad.
We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.</p>
<p>On the subject of funding, CryptPad will be presented at the <a href="https://fundthecode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fund the Code</a> event on March 19th in Paris, with XWiki SAS (CryptPad’s parent company) sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding.
It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>.
Check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project.
We are already making progress on this roadmap.</p>
<p>To finish, I’d like to give progress on CryptPad’s usage.
We are now reaching close to 250 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly.
The growth of CryptPad noticed in November has not stopped and now we have more than 1500 weekly drive users (from 1000 in November), more than 7000 weekly pad users (from 6000 in November).</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-driveuniqueweek.png" alt="cryptpad drive stats">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-padsuniqueweek.png" alt="cryptpad pad stats"></p>
<p>A special note to our German users where CryptPad is growing quickly.
We have noticed on Twitter that teachers promoting are CryptPad in their community and there are now more users from Germany than from the US, making it the top country representing 25% of the CryptPad.fr users and also of the CryptPad hosted instances.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-countries.png" alt="cryptpad countries"></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try CryptPad</a>, love it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take care of it</a>, and even better <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come help</a>!</p>

        <p>Our mission is to make privacy-enhancing technologies accessible to people from all over the world.
We get a lot of attention for the technology that we build, but that technology may be of limited use to those who can’t understand what it’s doing.
I’m not talking about <em>how the cryptography in CryptPad works</em>, but the simple matter of reading the text displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>CryptPad has been translated into <em>nine different languages</em>, but only a third of those translations are complete.
Members of the development team are fluent in English and French, so those are easily maintained, but the rest are beyond our ability.</p>
<p><img src="/images/translations-status.png" alt="translations status"></p>
<p>The other translations were written by contributors, but our required format made them difficult to maintain, so we understand why so many have become out of date.
With that in mind, we’ve decided to adopt the open-source <a href="https://weblate.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weblate translation platform</a> for our project to make the process more manageable.
If you’re familiar with CryptPad and fluent in any language other than English or French, <em>we’d love your help</em> translating the project.</p>
<p>You don’t have to do it alone, and it doesn’t need to be done all at once.
Weblate allows translators to change one string at a time in a nice web interface, with issues sorted by type.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weblate-interface.png" alt="Weblate translation interface"></p>
<p>Anyone can register an account on our instance (<a href="https://weblate.cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weblate.cryptpad.fr</a>).
From there, we can appoint <em>reviewers</em> for each language who will receive notifications any time their language receives a suggested update.</p>
<p>If you’d like to translate CryptPad into a new language, that will require a little more involvement on our part, but we’d be very happy to help.
Our <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/master/customize.dist/translations/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation guide</a> has more detailed information, but you can always <a href="mailto:weblate@cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a> if you’d like to help.</p>
<p>Even if your preferred language is already translated, we still welcome improvements to the existing translations.
Feel free to sign up and make suggestions, or stop by <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cryptpad:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our chat room</a> if you find any part of the platform difficult to understand.</p>

        <p>There’s a fairly long list of people who have helped make CryptPad what it is today, but on a day-to-day basis its improvements are driven primarily by myself and a colleague who would rather push code than take credit for his work.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy engineers</a> we’re most excited about building and deploying new features that help people move away from less private platforms.
Even so, it’s important to step away from building new things occasionally to both promote what we’ve done so far and ask people what they think of it.</p>
<p>Since our small team handles everything related to the project (including development, deployment, support, and promotion) the coming release will take place three weeks after <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/2.17.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last</a> to allow us to focus on meeting users.
As <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2018/11/13/CryptPad-receives-NGI-Startup-Award/">previously announced</a>, we’ve been invited to the <a href="https://awards.ngi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI awards</a> which will be colocated with the <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona.</p>
<p>I’ll be accepting the NGI startup award for <em>Privacy and trust-enhanced technologies</em> along with Ludovic Dubost (my boss and the CEO of XWiki).
If you’ll be in the city at the same time I encourage you to reach out to us via Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fc00ansuz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fc00ansuz</a>) or Mastodon (<a href="https://framapiaf.org/@ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>).</p>
<p>I plan to announce our plans for the coming months in a more formal roadmap, however, if we meet in person I’ll be happy to muse about the project’s trajectory in a casual setting.
Come say hi, tell me what you’d like to see, and you might see it land in an upcoming release!</p>

<p>I’ve now let a few months pass since the last August status. I’m sorry about that as I have been very busy with XWiki SAS activities as well as conferences including CryptPad talks.</p>
<p>I use this occasion to post the links to the different talks we had to present CryptPad and our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/HUJaxog3vrIJpJJ37-kDAecBJN7Y8yblLtjQEYrUSWU/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toulouse Capitole du Libre (French)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/d9tE0ekARv6YYcDroYIrLQelPpwnUbYNMQnLYHJXpDk/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris Open Source Summit in the Privacy Track (French)</a></li>
<li>Paris Open Source Summit in the Solutions Track (English by Aaron)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also been busy preparing some other funding opportunities for CryptPad which we believe can help bring more development to the project. Rest assured we are hard at work to make it happen. By the way, if you are an independent developer in Europe and you would like to be funded to work on a CryptPad project, contact us, we could have an opportunity for you.</p>
<p>Also I wanted to announce that in addition to the NGI Award “Privacy and Trust Enhanding Technologies” received last month for CryptPad, XWiki SAS has now also received an award at the Paris Open Source Summit from the CNLL (Conseil National du Logiciel Libre). This award “Enterprise Award for an Open and Ethical Digital” (Prix de l’Entreprise pour un numérique ouvert et éthique), recognizes XWiki SAS’ involvement in sustainable free software development for the last 15 years. This of course includes our involvement in CryptPad and working hard to bring this free software solution to life and sustain its development. We are very proud of it and are committed to honor this award in the future.</p>
<p>Again we are grateful for our donators and subscribers as well as to all that relay our communications about the CryptPad crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>In the last three months we have received 1000 Euros from subscriptions and donations. this number has been growing in particular since we have launched yearly payments for subscriptions. </p>
<p>We have now exceeded 4000 Euros in funding for CryptPad since the beginning, including 1000 Euros of donations. This funding comes from 65 different sources from 19 different countries. 26 donators are coming through Open Collective.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-revenues-details.png" alt="cryptpad funding details">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-countries.png" alt="cryptpad funding by type">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-revenuesources.png" alt="cryptpad funding by country"></p>
<p>While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing. We hope to continue to grow subscriptions and donators and have between 6k and 10k Euros by the end of the OpenPAAS NG project which currently funds us. Progressively we are getting close to secure funding for the project.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad. We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>. Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. We are already making progress on this roadmap.</p>
<p>Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, have released the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded feature. We have also worked on improving the reliability of the synchronization engine (chainpad).</p>
<p>To finish, I’d like to give progress on CryptPad’s usage. We are now reaching close to 200 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly. We have seen a surge in the last weeks, maybe related to the conferences, and we have now more than 1000 drive users, and 6000 pad visitors per week. The activity has almost doubled in 4 month.</p>

<p>Of course XWiki SAS and the CryptPad team are very proud of this award for a project that was started 4 years ago by Caleb James DeLisle as part of a French research project funding realtime editing in XWiki. The first commit <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/commit/1508c7ba71f5de5e51f061fbef45bc1f18493832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“<strong>and so it begins</strong>“</a> was premonitory of a long and important project.</p>
<p>But most importantly we are very happy that privacy enhancing technologies are getting recognized. We strongly believe that users of internet technologies should be able to control their privacy and the security of their data, and unfortunately this is not the case today. The dominating business model of the Internet is advertisement based on exploiting user data (“Your data is their data”). Cloud providers have full access to most of users’ and companies’ private data, which is being exposed to many risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our promise is that our software <strong>cannot</strong> spy on its users, and that your data is safe.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also very happy that our users and supporters are recognized. Since we launched our online service CryptPad.fr as part of the OpenPaaS-NG research project, funded by BPI France, CryptPad’s usage and support has continously grown. With more than 10000 users weekly and also the support from paying users and donations through our Open Collective, we are all participating in helping restore our privacy.</p>
<p>It is difficult for all of us to give up powerful Internet services and software which bring us great value, but at the same time we do not like to see how our data is being used for advertisement, political means or malicious hacking. Today this NGI Award is showing that it is possible to take back our privacy, while getting powerful and easy to use services. We built CryptPad to show how far a team can go to empower users and increase their expectation of privacy from online services. While it was previously accepted that collaborative editing meant sacrificing confidentiality, we’ve not only proven that private editing is possible, but we’ve made our entire platform open source to ensure that this technology remains available.</p>

<h2 id="About-CryptPad-and-XWiki-SAS"><a href="#About-CryptPad-and-XWiki-SAS" class="headerlink" title="About CryptPad and XWiki SAS"></a>About CryptPad and XWiki SAS</h2><p>CryptPad is an open-source, web-based suite of collaborative editors which employs client-side cryptography to ensure that the server is not able to access the contents of users’ documents.
It offers a variety of editors and other multi-user applications: rich text, code editing with syntax highlighting and markdown preview, presentations, polls for scheduling, kanbans for project management, and whiteboards for collaborative illustration.</p>
<p>CryptPad is being actively developed by XWiki SAS and is currently funded by BPI France as part of the OpenPaaS NG research project. For the last 14 years, XWiki SAS has built Open Source Collaboration Software and provided professional services allowing organizations to better organize their information.</p>
<h2 id="About-the-NGI-Initiative-and-awards"><a href="#About-the-NGI-Initiative-and-awards" class="headerlink" title="About the NGI Initiative and awards"></a>About the NGI Initiative and awards</h2><p>NGI is Europe’s new approach to creating a more human-centric internet. It invites citizens and communities striving for values like openness, inclusivity, transparency, privacy, cooperation, and data protection to provide input, and thus to help to guide the European Next Generation Internet funding agenda. NGI is a European Commission initiative which is being implemented by project partners throughout Europe.</p>
<p>The overall mission of the Next Generation Internet initiative is to re-imagine and re-engineer the Internet for the third millennium and beyond. We envision the information age will be an era that brings out the best in all of us. We want to enable human potential, mobility and creativity at the largest possible scale – while dealing responsibly with our natural resources. In order to preserve and expand the European way of life, we shape a value-centric, human and inclusive Internet for all.</p>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>We’ve been making a big deal of our funding status for the last while, and for good reason.
CryptPad has largely been funded by the <a href="https://open-paas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenPaaS</a> research and development project, funded by <a href="http://www.bpifrance.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BPIFrance</a>.
We’re very happy with the results of the past four years of work, but this support will terminate at the end of March 2019.</p>
<p>While this change is a bit scary for us, it also means that we’ll be free to pursue new research projects.
Europe is investing in technologies that promote human-centric values, so there are many opportunities that align with our goals.
We have been actively seeking funding from a variety of sources, and though things are currently uncertain for us, it’s quite likely that <strong>our team will need to expand</strong> to prepare for upcoming obligations.</p>
<h2 id="The-skills-we-want"><a href="#The-skills-we-want" class="headerlink" title="The skills we want"></a>The skills we want</h2><p>We’re looking for <em>web technologists</em> and <em>product designers</em> with experience in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy engineering</a>.
If you already use CryptPad, encrypted messengers, or other similar communication systems to protect your personal data, that knowledge will be an asset.
If you use unencrypted platforms and have a good understanding of the personal and societal trade-offs, that will count in your favour as well.</p>
<p>This field is fairly young, so we’re open to any experience you have, not just what you’ve learned in a professional or academic context.</p>
<p>In terms of technical skills, our daily work typically includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clientside Javascript (ES5) and cross-platform browser APIs</li>
<li>Nodejs</li>
<li>CSS3 and LESS</li>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li>BASH</li>
<li>GIT</li>
<li>SSH, information security, and basic system administration</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re interested in incorporating skills we don’t already have, so don’t panic if you’re unfamiliar with anything listed above.</p>
<p>Perhaps more important than the technical skills are the so-called <em>soft skills</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Empathizing with users and prioritizing improvements based on their impact</li>
<li>Communicating well within a team (including asking for clarification if your goals are ever unclear)</li>
<li>Managing your time well (we avoid micro-managing and working overtime)</li>
<li>Reasoning about pragmatic security</li>
<li>Consideration of both immediate tasks and long-term goals</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="What-we-offer"><a href="#What-we-offer" class="headerlink" title="What we offer"></a>What we offer</h2><p>XWiki SAS has been developing open-source software for the last 15 years, and we rely on the open-source tooling internally.
Joining our team means learning how to run a sustainable business while giving away our product for free (without selling user data).</p>
<p>Otherwise you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>A relaxed work environment (in <em>Paris, France</em> or <em>Iasi, Romania</em>) with part-time remote work<ul>
<li>or negotiable full-time if relocation is not possible or desireable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To develop portable skills using open-source software</li>
<li>International travel (at our expense) when promoting the company or our projects</li>
<li>Opportunities for advancement, training, and other benefits</li>
<li>The chance to shape the future of an exciting project with your personal view of responsible data handling</li>
<li>To become an expert in privacy-enhancing technologies (we’re literally an <em>award-winning team</em>) <img src="/images/xwiki-awards-tweet.png" alt="Awards for XWiki and CryptPad"></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-special-note-to-researchers"><a href="#A-special-note-to-researchers" class="headerlink" title="A special note to researchers"></a>A special note to researchers</h2><p>We’re very interested in distributed systems, data science (as an adversary against privacy), and human-computer interaction.
If you are knowledgeable about any of these, some intersection, or anything else that might be relevant, that’s great!</p>
<p>If you have recently attained a PhD from an institution recognized by the EU, there are subsidies which can help us pay your salary.
We have authored two peer-reviewed papers to date, so we can offer continued involvement in the research community if you desire.</p>
<h2 id="Caveats"><a href="#Caveats" class="headerlink" title="Caveats"></a>Caveats</h2><p>Sorting through CVs can be a lot of work, though a little transparency on some issues might help lighten the burden on our side.
Below are some things to consider before contacting us.</p>
<p>As stated above, our ability to hire will be based on the status of some pending proposals.
We don’t currently know how many positions will be available, and our timeline on when we could hire is fuzzy at best.
We’d like to have your profile ready so we can act quickly once we know more.</p>
<p>We can’t compete with the salaries offered by companies in Silicon Valley, though they are comparable to other European businesses.
As a consolation, you’ll be directly involved in determining how we move forward, and you’ll gain insight into the exciting European research ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our funding sources tend to place restrictions limiting those funds to residents of European member states.
I moved to France from Canada to work on CryptPad several years ago, but things are generally simpler if you’re already here.
Don’t let that stop you from contacting us, though!</p>
<p>We understand that talent comes in many forms, and we welcome new ideas.
We’re willing to make exceptions for promising candidates, but we’d like to know that you care about the topic.
There are probably better options available if you just want <em>a job</em>.</p>
<h2 id="If-you-are-interested…"><a href="#If-you-are-interested…" class="headerlink" title="If you are interested…"></a>If you are interested…</h2><p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:jobs@cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jobs@cryptpad.fr</a> with a recent CV and a brief introduction explaining what you’d bring to the team.</p>

<p>The beginning of the year has been busy.
We <a href="/2019/02/22/Heading-to-Barcelona/">traveled to Barcelona</a> to officially receive our NGI Award.
Spreadsheet functionality was officially released in CryptPad and our funding has been progressing since <a href="/2018/12/09/CryptPad-funding-status-November-2018/">our last status in November</a>.</p>
<p>We have seen a spike of both new subscriptions and growing usage of <a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptPad.fr</a> in the last few months.
You can see the numbers in <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/ppScrSTQQy7gQ6gwYG2pSvNzedP0mHhhFHWwPl5P+Vk/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the new spreadsheet function launched in January</a> (though this functionality is still restricted to registered users).</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-funding.png?v=2" alt="CryptPad funding details"></p>
<p>We now have more than 100 backers from 23 countries around the world.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-funding-countries.png" alt="CryptPad funding by country"></p>
<p>While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing.
We will reach a first goal of 6k by the end of the OpenPaaS-NG project ending this month.
We have also candidated to the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/news/2019/20190201-call.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NLNet Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technology funding call</a>. </p>
<p>Now we need more help!
First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space.
Proprietary software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding.
If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad.
We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.</p>
<p>On the subject of funding, CryptPad will be presented at the <a href="https://fundthecode.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fund the Code</a> event on March 19th in Paris, with XWiki SAS (CryptPad’s parent company) sponsoring the event.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding.
It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>.
Check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project.
We are already making progress on this roadmap.</p>
<p>To finish, I’d like to give progress on CryptPad’s usage.
We are now reaching close to 250 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly.
The growth of CryptPad noticed in November has not stopped and now we have more than 1500 weekly drive users (from 1000 in November), more than 7000 weekly pad users (from 6000 in November).</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-driveuniqueweek.png" alt="cryptpad drive stats">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-padsuniqueweek.png" alt="cryptpad pad stats"></p>
<p>A special note to our German users where CryptPad is growing quickly.
We have noticed on Twitter that teachers promoting are CryptPad in their community and there are now more users from Germany than from the US, making it the top country representing 25% of the CryptPad.fr users and also of the CryptPad hosted instances.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201902-countries.png" alt="cryptpad countries"></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try CryptPad</a>, love it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take care of it</a>, and even better <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come help</a>!</p>

        <p>Our mission is to make privacy-enhancing technologies accessible to people from all over the world.
We get a lot of attention for the technology that we build, but that technology may be of limited use to those who can’t understand what it’s doing.
I’m not talking about <em>how the cryptography in CryptPad works</em>, but the simple matter of reading the text displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>CryptPad has been translated into <em>nine different languages</em>, but only a third of those translations are complete.
Members of the development team are fluent in English and French, so those are easily maintained, but the rest are beyond our ability.</p>
<p><img src="/images/translations-status.png" alt="translations status"></p>
<p>The other translations were written by contributors, but our required format made them difficult to maintain, so we understand why so many have become out of date.
With that in mind, we’ve decided to adopt the open-source <a href="https://weblate.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Weblate translation platform</a> for our project to make the process more manageable.
If you’re familiar with CryptPad and fluent in any language other than English or French, <em>we’d love your help</em> translating the project.</p>
<p>You don’t have to do it alone, and it doesn’t need to be done all at once.
Weblate allows translators to change one string at a time in a nice web interface, with issues sorted by type.</p>
<p><img src="/images/weblate-interface.png" alt="Weblate translation interface"></p>
<p>Anyone can register an account on our instance (<a href="https://weblate.cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weblate.cryptpad.fr</a>).
From there, we can appoint <em>reviewers</em> for each language who will receive notifications any time their language receives a suggested update.</p>
<p>If you’d like to translate CryptPad into a new language, that will require a little more involvement on our part, but we’d be very happy to help.
Our <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/master/customize.dist/translations/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translation guide</a> has more detailed information, but you can always <a href="mailto:weblate@cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contact us</a> if you’d like to help.</p>
<p>Even if your preferred language is already translated, we still welcome improvements to the existing translations.
Feel free to sign up and make suggestions, or stop by <a href="https://riot.im/app/#/room/#cryptpad:matrix.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our chat room</a> if you find any part of the platform difficult to understand.</p>

        <p>There’s a fairly long list of people who have helped make CryptPad what it is today, but on a day-to-day basis its improvements are driven primarily by myself and a colleague who would rather push code than take credit for his work.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy engineers</a> we’re most excited about building and deploying new features that help people move away from less private platforms.
Even so, it’s important to step away from building new things occasionally to both promote what we’ve done so far and ask people what they think of it.</p>
<p>Since our small team handles everything related to the project (including development, deployment, support, and promotion) the coming release will take place three weeks after <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/2.17.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last</a> to allow us to focus on meeting users.
As <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2018/11/13/CryptPad-receives-NGI-Startup-Award/">previously announced</a>, we’ve been invited to the <a href="https://awards.ngi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI awards</a> which will be colocated with the <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona.</p>
<p>I’ll be accepting the NGI startup award for <em>Privacy and trust-enhanced technologies</em> along with Ludovic Dubost (my boss and the CEO of XWiki).
If you’ll be in the city at the same time I encourage you to reach out to us via Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fc00ansuz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fc00ansuz</a>) or Mastodon (<a href="https://framapiaf.org/@ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>).</p>
<p>I plan to announce our plans for the coming months in a more formal roadmap, however, if we meet in person I’ll be happy to muse about the project’s trajectory in a casual setting.
Come say hi, tell me what you’d like to see, and you might see it land in an upcoming release!</p>

<p>I’ve now let a few months pass since the last August status. I’m sorry about that as I have been very busy with XWiki SAS activities as well as conferences including CryptPad talks.</p>
<p>I use this occasion to post the links to the different talks we had to present CryptPad and our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/HUJaxog3vrIJpJJ37-kDAecBJN7Y8yblLtjQEYrUSWU/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toulouse Capitole du Libre (French)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/d9tE0ekARv6YYcDroYIrLQelPpwnUbYNMQnLYHJXpDk/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris Open Source Summit in the Privacy Track (French)</a></li>
<li>Paris Open Source Summit in the Solutions Track (English by Aaron)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also been busy preparing some other funding opportunities for CryptPad which we believe can help bring more development to the project. Rest assured we are hard at work to make it happen. By the way, if you are an independent developer in Europe and you would like to be funded to work on a CryptPad project, contact us, we could have an opportunity for you.</p>
<p>Also I wanted to announce that in addition to the NGI Award “Privacy and Trust Enhanding Technologies” received last month for CryptPad, XWiki SAS has now also received an award at the Paris Open Source Summit from the CNLL (Conseil National du Logiciel Libre). This award “Enterprise Award for an Open and Ethical Digital” (Prix de l’Entreprise pour un numérique ouvert et éthique), recognizes XWiki SAS’ involvement in sustainable free software development for the last 15 years. This of course includes our involvement in CryptPad and working hard to bring this free software solution to life and sustain its development. We are very proud of it and are committed to honor this award in the future.</p>
<p>Again we are grateful for our donators and subscribers as well as to all that relay our communications about the CryptPad crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>In the last three months we have received 1000 Euros from subscriptions and donations. this number has been growing in particular since we have launched yearly payments for subscriptions. </p>
<p>We have now exceeded 4000 Euros in funding for CryptPad since the beginning, including 1000 Euros of donations. This funding comes from 65 different sources from 19 different countries. 26 donators are coming through Open Collective.</p>

<img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-revenuesources.png" alt="cryptpad funding by country"></p>
<p>While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing. We hope to continue to grow subscriptions and donators and have between 6k and 10k Euros by the end of the OpenPAAS NG project which currently funds us. Progressively we are getting close to secure funding for the project.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad. We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>. Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. We are already making progress on this roadmap.</p>
<p>Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, have released the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded feature. We have also worked on improving the reliability of the synchronization engine (chainpad).</p>
<p>To finish, I’d like to give progress on CryptPad’s usage. We are now reaching close to 200 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly. We have seen a surge in the last weeks, maybe related to the conferences, and we have now more than 1000 drive users, and 6000 pad visitors per week. The activity has almost doubled in 4 month.</p>

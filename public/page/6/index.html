        <p>There’s a fairly long list of people who have helped make CryptPad what it is today, but on a day-to-day basis its improvements are driven primarily by myself and a colleague who would rather push code than take credit for his work.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy engineers</a> we’re most excited about building and deploying new features that help people move away from less private platforms.
Even so, it’s important to step away from building new things occasionally to both promote what we’ve done so far and ask people what they think of it.</p>
<p>Since our small team handles everything related to the project (including development, deployment, support, and promotion) the coming release will take place three weeks after <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/2.17.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our last</a> to allow us to focus on meeting users.
As <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2018/11/13/CryptPad-receives-NGI-Startup-Award/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a>, we’ve been invited to the <a href="https://awards.ngi.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI awards</a> which will be colocated with the <a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona.</p>
<p>I’ll be accepting the NGI startup award for <em>Privacy and trust-enhanced technologies</em> along with Ludovic Dubost (my boss and the CEO of XWiki).
If you’ll be in the city at the same time I encourage you to reach out to us via Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/fc00ansuz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@fc00ansuz</a>) or Mastodon (<a href="https://framapiaf.org/@ldubost" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ldubost</a>, <a href="https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@cryptpad</a>).</p>
<p>I plan to announce our plans for the coming months in a more formal roadmap, however, if we meet in person I’ll be happy to muse about the project’s trajectory in a casual setting.
Come say hi, tell me what you’d like to see, and you might see it land in an upcoming release!</p>

<p>I’ve now let a few months pass since the last August status. I’m sorry about that as I have been very busy with XWiki SAS activities as well as conferences including CryptPad talks.</p>
<p>I use this occasion to post the links to the different talks we had to present CryptPad and our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/HUJaxog3vrIJpJJ37-kDAecBJN7Y8yblLtjQEYrUSWU/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toulouse Capitole du Libre (French)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/d9tE0ekARv6YYcDroYIrLQelPpwnUbYNMQnLYHJXpDk/embed/present/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paris Open Source Summit in the Privacy Track (French)</a></li>
<li>Paris Open Source Summit in the Solutions Track (English by Aaron)</li>
</ul>
<p>We have also been busy preparing some other funding opportunities for CryptPad which we believe can help bring more development to the project. Rest assured we are hard at work to make it happen. By the way, if you are an independent developer in Europe and you would like to be funded to work on a CryptPad project, contact us, we could have an opportunity for you.</p>
<p>Also I wanted to announce that in addition to the NGI Award “Privacy and Trust Enhanding Technologies” received last month for CryptPad, XWiki SAS has now also received an award at the Paris Open Source Summit from the CNLL (Conseil National du Logiciel Libre). This award “Enterprise Award for an Open and Ethical Digital” (Prix de l’Entreprise pour un numérique ouvert et éthique), recognizes XWiki SAS’ involvement in sustainable free software development for the last 15 years. This of course includes our involvement in CryptPad and working hard to bring this free software solution to life and sustain its development. We are very proud of it and are committed to honor this award in the future.</p>
<p>Again we are grateful for our donators and subscribers as well as to all that relay our communications about the CryptPad crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>In the last three months we have received 1000 Euros from subscriptions and donations. this number has been growing in particular since we have launched yearly payments for subscriptions. </p>
<p>We have now exceeded 4000 Euros in funding for CryptPad since the beginning, including 1000 Euros of donations. This funding comes from 65 different sources from 19 different countries. 26 donators are coming through Open Collective.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-revenues-details.png" alt="cryptpad funding details">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-countries.png" alt="cryptpad funding by type">
<img src="/images/cryptpad-201811-revenuesources.png" alt="cryptpad funding by country"></p>
<p>While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing. We hope to continue to grow subscriptions and donators and have between 6k and 10k Euros by the end of the OpenPAAS NG project which currently funds us. Progressively we are getting close to secure funding for the project.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad. We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>. Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. We are already making progress on this roadmap.</p>
<p>Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, have released the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded feature. We have also worked on improving the reliability of the synchronization engine (chainpad).</p>
<p>To finish, I’d like to give progress on CryptPad’s usage. We are now reaching close to 200 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly. We have seen a surge in the last weeks, maybe related to the conferences, and we have now more than 1000 drive users, and 6000 pad visitors per week. The activity has almost doubled in 4 month.</p>

<p><strong>Europe recognizes Privacy, and it’s starting with CryptPad</strong></p>
<p>Europe’s Next Generation Internet initiative (<a href="https://www.NGI.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NGI.eu</a>) awarded CryptPad the Next Generation Internet’s <a href="https://awards.ngi.eu/winners-startup-awards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy and trust-enhanced technologies startup award</a>. The NGI Startup Awards recognize Europe’s most disruptive entrepreneurs who are advancing revolutionary products, solutions and services destined to have a major impact on the internet of the future.</p>
<p>Of course XWiki SAS and the CryptPad team are very proud of this award for a project that was started 4 years ago by Caleb James DeLisle as part of a French research project funding realtime editing in XWiki. The first commit <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/commit/1508c7ba71f5de5e51f061fbef45bc1f18493832" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“<strong>and so it begins</strong>“</a> was premonitory of a long and important project.</p>
<p>But most importantly we are very happy that privacy enhancing technologies are getting recognized. We strongly believe that users of internet technologies should be able to control their privacy and the security of their data, and unfortunately this is not the case today. The dominating business model of the Internet is advertisement based on exploiting user data (“Your data is their data”). Cloud providers have full access to most of users’ and companies’ private data, which is being exposed to many risks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our promise is that our software <strong>cannot</strong> spy on its users, and that your data is safe.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also very happy that our users and supporters are recognized. Since we launched our online service CryptPad.fr as part of the OpenPaaS-NG research project, funded by BPI France, CryptPad’s usage and support has continously grown. With more than 10000 users weekly and also the support from paying users and donations through our Open Collective, we are all participating in helping restore our privacy.</p>
<p>It is difficult for all of us to give up powerful Internet services and software which bring us great value, but at the same time we do not like to see how our data is being used for advertisement, political means or malicious hacking. Today this NGI Award is showing that it is possible to take back our privacy, while getting powerful and easy to use services. We built CryptPad to show how far a team can go to empower users and increase their expectation of privacy from online services. While it was previously accepted that collaborative editing meant sacrificing confidentiality, we’ve not only proven that private editing is possible, but we’ve made our entire platform open source to ensure that this technology remains available.</p>

<h2 id="About-the-NGI-Initiative-and-awards"><a href="#About-the-NGI-Initiative-and-awards" class="headerlink" title="About the NGI Initiative and awards"></a>About the NGI Initiative and awards</h2><p>NGI is Europe’s new approach to creating a more human-centric internet. It invites citizens and communities striving for values like openness, inclusivity, transparency, privacy, cooperation, and data protection to provide input, and thus to help to guide the European Next Generation Internet funding agenda. NGI is a European Commission initiative which is being implemented by project partners throughout Europe.</p>
<p>The overall mission of the Next Generation Internet initiative is to re-imagine and re-engineer the Internet for the third millennium and beyond. We envision the information age will be an era that brings out the best in all of us. We want to enable human potential, mobility and creativity at the largest possible scale – while dealing responsibly with our natural resources. In order to preserve and expand the European way of life, we shape a value-centric, human and inclusive Internet for all.</p>

<p>We have now passed the summer since we have started the OpenCollective for CryptPad and started our campaign for funding CryptPad and ensuring its future in 2019, so I wanted to give an update on this funding initiative.</p>
<p>First we are highly grateful to all that have responded positively and also that have relayed our campaign. We do feel stronger with the help of our community and it motivates us more.</p>
<p>We have now received a few more contributions during this month of August, and in particular a 100 Euro donation from Matthieu Herrb. In July we had received a commitment from the <a href="https://c3w.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C3Wien Community</a> in Austria, to contribute 360 Euros / year as well as some of their members to whom our communication was relayed. We have also received a few donations for more than 50 Euros coming from the USA and Germany (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegoelzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Goelzer</a>, KimoNine, shibayashi) and also monthly donations (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/dangagliar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniele Gagliardi</a> and an anonymous backer !) and one time donations reaching now more than <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 donators through OpenCollective</a>.</p>
<p>We also had new subscribers to the CryptPad subscriptions and in total now we can count on 40 participants to CryptPad funding for a total now of 320 Euros for the month of August and 2250 Euros since subscriptions started last year. This funding originates from 11 different countries around the world. </p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-countries-201808.png" alt="funding by country"></p>
<p>XWiki SAS is also matching the donations we received since the beginning of the campaign and we are now reaching a budget of 2614 Euros on OpenCollective.</p>
<p>This amount is of course still low and not enough to guarantee funding next year for CryptPad, but it’s a start without much communication about the funding of CryptPad and about the long term objectives of this project. We still have 7 months to grow this funding to contribute to the development of CryptPad.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some way of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding.

Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, are already hard at work and the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded features, is already advancing very fast. During the summer there are has been <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 new releases of CryptPad</a></p>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try CryptPad</a>, love it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take care of it</a>, and even better <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come help</a> !</p>

        <p><img src="/images/cryptpad-funding-blog-cover.png" alt="one month funding status"></p>
<p>It’s been a month now that we have started the OpenCollective for CryptPad and started our campaign for funding CryptPad and insuring it’s future in 2019, so I wanted to give a status on this funding initiative.</p>
<p>First we are highly grateful to all that have responded positively and also that have relayed our campaign. We do feel stronger with the help of our community and it motivates us more.</p>
<p>In particular we have received a commitment from the <a href="https://c3w.at/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C3Wien Community</a> in Austria, to contribute 360 Euros / year as well as some of their members to whom our communication was relayed. We have also received a few donations for more than 50 Euros coming from the USA and Austria (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegoelzer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Goelzer</a>, KimoNine, shibayashi) and also monthly donations (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/dangagliar" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniele Gagliardi</a> and an anonymous backer !) and one time donations reaching now more than <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#contributors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 donators through OpenCollective</a>.</p>
<p>We also had new subscribers to the CryptPad subscriptions and in total now we can count on 30 participants to CryptPad funding for a total now of 750 Euros for the month of July and 2000 Euros since subscriptions started last year. This funding originates from 11 different countries around the world and actually not yet from France our home country who has funded the beginning of CryptPad with the OpenPAAS project. </p>
<p><img src="/images/cryptpad-countries.jpg" alt="funding by country"></p>
<p>This amount is of course still low and not enough to guarantee funding next year for CryptPad, but it’s a start without much communication about the funding of CryptPad and about the long term objectives of this project.</p>
<p>Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some way of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a <a href="/tags/roadmap/">roadmap for CryptPad</a> of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It’s also available on the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenCollective web site</a>. Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, are already hard at work and the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded features, is already advancing very fast.</p>
<p>We want also to take the opportunity to thank Caleb James De Lisle, the creator of CryptPad, who has left XWiki SAS at the end of July to pursue his own projects (CJDNS and others). Caleb has done incredible work first creating CryptPad and also on XWiki SAS managing our research projects for the last few years. CryptPad’s development is in good hands with Aaron and Yann who have been the main commiters of the project in the last year. In the last few month he has helped setup the Open Collective and the roadmap to help fund CryptPad in the future. I will now relay him on this aspect and we are a looking for a new team member to <a href="https://www.xwiki.com/en/jobs/research-and-development-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join our research funding initiative and lead CryptPad on the non-technical aspects</a>. I’m sure Caleb won’t fully leave us and at least be a regular adviser to the project.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptpad.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Try CryptPad</a>, love it, <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take care of it</a>, and even better <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come help</a> !</p>
<p>Ludovic Dubost &amp; the CryptPad Team</p>

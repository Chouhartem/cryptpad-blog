<p>CryptPad and the team have received some attention recently through various channels: a Reddit AMA thread, podcast, presentation, and blog interview. Whether you prefer to read, watch or listen there is a way for you to get an up-to-date presentation of CryptPad.</p>
<p>Aaron MacSween was invited for an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/k1uonq/im_aaron_macsween_project_lead_for_cryptpad_the/">Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread on r/privacy</a> on Reddit. The thread started on November 27th 2020 and lasted for a couple of days. 98 questions were raised about everything from CryptPad's business model, to future development plans, the broader state of open-source software, and the EU's recent debates against encryption.</p>
<p>Aaron was also a guest on the <a href="https://www.jamesmullarkey.com/2020/11/imagine-google-docs-but-without-the-spyware-with-aaron-macsween/">We Don't Stream podcast</a> in an episode titled <em>Imagine Google Docs but without the spyware</em>. This was a general presentation of CryptPad, the origin story and the motivations behind it. Each guest is asked to nominate an NGO to encourage donations.

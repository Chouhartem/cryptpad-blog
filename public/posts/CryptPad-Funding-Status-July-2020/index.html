<p>We have not been very active on the CryptPad blog lately, however, we have been very active making <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/">new releases to CryptPad</a>.</p>
<p>We have also published some news about our funding on our <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#section-updates">Open Collective page</a> and in particular the <a href="https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/updates/cryptpad-funding-status-july-2020">July 2020 funding status article</a>.</p>

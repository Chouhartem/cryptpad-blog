<p>This is just a quick announcement to say that we've moved our blog from <strong>blog.cryptpad.fr</strong> to <strong>blog.cryptpad.org</strong>. Visitors to the old URL will be automatically redirected to the new one. Anyone who has subscribed to its RSS feed will continue to get updates for the new address.</p>
<p>This blog is the first of a few services that we plan to host under the <em>CryptPad.org</em> domain. Our goal is to provide some better separation between <em>CryptPad</em> (the open-source project) and <em>CryptPad.fr</em> (the public instance that we host). In the near future we plan to introduce a project website featuring general information, an overview of our roadmap and finances, and a directory of public instances.</p>

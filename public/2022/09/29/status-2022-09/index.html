    <h2>5.1 release</h2>
<p>This month we released <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/5.1.0">CryptPad 5.1</a> that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New features for instance adminstrators. We added a &quot;Database&quot; tab in the admin panel that makes it easier to review metadata on user accounts and documents in cases where malicious activity is reported.</li>
<li>New translations in Spanish and Portugese (Portugal) thanks to the work of volunteers.</li>
<li>Many smaller improvements and bug fixes such as asciidoc syntax highlighting in Code documents.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The team keeps growing</h2>
<p>We're happy to welcome Theo to the team starting in October. He has recently completed a master in cyber security at ETH Zurich. Theo will relocate to Paris for 6 months to work on documenting the use of cryptography in CryptPad and pave the way for future developments.</p>
<p>We are also happy to announce that we have signed with antoher new hire, a senior developer from Germany. We will give more details on this when they join the team full-time in January 2023.</p>
<h2>Next up</h2>
<p>We took advantage of the XWiki seminar hackathon last week to set up a <a href="https://forum.cryptpad.org">new forum for CryptPad</a> using <a href="https://flarum.org/">Flarum</a>. We will be sharing the details shortly. This new forum will centralize discussions around CryptPad, part living documentation part pre-roadmap for the project.</p>
<p>Calendar improvements didn't quite make it into 5.1, but they are coming along nicely. The much-requested feature of recurring events will defintely be part of the next release, and deployed to Cryptpad.fr before that.</p>

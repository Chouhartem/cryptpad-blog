    <h1>November 2021 status: Talks and testimonials</h1>

    <p>This month we released some minor fixes with <a href="https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.12.1">4.12.1</a>. We have been busy making preparations for the upcoming upgrade to OnlyOffice 6.4.2. This will include the much-requested conditional formatting in Sheets and dark mode support. We have also spent time considering strategy and long-term goals as we prepare the project website, which brings us to:</p>
<h2>Call for project site testimonials</h2>
<p>As we have <a href="https://blog.cryptpad.org/2021/09/15/Relocating-our-blog/">mentioned before</a> we are currently working on a project website for CryptPad. This will be used to promote the project and to better communicate the distinction between CryptPad and cryptpad.fr (the flagship instance).</p>
<p>The new site will include a public instance list, new pricing for hosted instances, and pages tailored to various sectors such as NGOs, education, and enterprise.</p>
<p>We are planning to include testimonials on the site. If you use CryptPad and have a few minutes to share some words of support using <a href="https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/1NDX7MEkhzNz1FCrcjCxmvjgIj24QjWNncZygR60Ch8/">our new survey</a>, that would be much appreciated.</p>
<h2>Recent and upcoming talks</h2>
<p>Ludovic presented CryptPad at the <a href="https://www.campus-du-libre.org/prog.php">Campus du Libre</a> on 6th November in Lyon. We don't have video (yet) but the <a href="https://www.campus-du-libre.org/Supports/CampusDuLibre2021-CryptPad.pdf">slides are online</a> (in French).</p>
<p>David will present CryptPad to a healthcare and free software audience on December 10th as part of <a href="https://www.gnuhealthcon.org/2021/">GNU Health Con 2021</a>.</p>

<p>That's it for this month. We are looking forward to launching the new OnlyOffice editors, you will probably read about that in the next status update.</p>

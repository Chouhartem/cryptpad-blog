It has been a busy beginning of the year. We have officially received the NGI Award in Barcelona. We have released the spreadsheet functionnality in CryptPad and CryptPad's funding has been progressing since our last status in November. We are happy that we have now more than **100** backers and achieved 5kEuros of funding from our Cryptpad.fr subscribers and from donations.

We have seen in the last few month a spike of both new subscriptions and growing usage of CryptPad.fr. You can see the numbers in [the new spreadsheet function launched in January](https://cryptpad.fr/sheet/#/2/sheet/view/ppScrSTQQy7gQ6gwYG2pSvNzedP0mHhhFHWwPl5P+Vk/embed/present/)

We now have more than 100 backers from 23 countries around the world.

While this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing. We will reach a first goal of 6k by the end of the OpenPAAS NG project ending this month. We have also candidated to the [NLNet NGI Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technology funding call](https://nlnet.nl/news/2019/20190201-call.html). 

Now we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad. We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers. 

On the subject of funding, CryptPad will be presented at the [Fund the Code](https://fundthecode.org/) even on March 19th in Paris, and our main sponsoring company XWiki SAS will be sponsoring the event.

Since the launch of the campaign we have also published a [roadmap for CryptPad](/tags/roadmap/) of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It's also available on the [OpenCollective web site](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about). Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. We are already making progress on this roadmap.

Aaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, have now released the spreadsheet feature. Come and test the first encrypted spreadsheet realtime editor!

To finish, I'd like to give progress on CryptPad's usage. We are now reaching close to 250 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly. The growth of CryptPad noticed in November has not stoped and now we have more than 1500 weekly drive users (from 1000 in November), more than 7000 weekly pad users (from 6000 in November).

A special note to our German users where CryptPad is growing quickly. We have noticed on Twitter, teachers promoting CryptPad in their community and now there are now more users from Germany as users from the US, making it the top country representing 25% of the CryptPad.fr users and also of the CryptPad hosted instances.

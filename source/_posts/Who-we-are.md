[CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr) is a suite of tools for collaboration.

There are many tools available on the web that are intended to make you more productive, making it critical to be able to set ourselves apart.
With that in mind, we'd like to introduce ourselves, explain our investment in this field, and _how this relates to you_, our users and contributors.

## How we're different

When you use the web to share information with your friends and colleagues, you are also sharing it with the companies that host the service you use.

You probably don't need to worry about government organizations spying on you, but there are far more mundane reasons to protect your privacy.
We believe that it should be easy to organize your private thoughts without making those thoughts available to advertising agencies, or anyone else willing to pay a modest price.

The _Crypt_ in _CryptPad_ means that while you collaborate with your peers, your data is scrambled such that we can't read it.
The only people who will know what you've written are those with whom you share your document's secret key.

## Where we come from

CryptPad is developed by a few people at [XWiki SAS](http://xwiki.com), a small employee-owned company located in Paris, France.
XWiki has been committed to the Open Source model since 2004, and has attracted many developers who are passionate about contributing to an open and ethical web.

XWiki's earns its revenue through custom development and support for our flagship project, _the XWiki Enterprise Wiki_.
We've built a sustainable business while making the complete source code for XWiki freely available, while competing data siloes like Confluence use vendor lock-in to keep their customers dependent on their services.

## How we fund CryptPad

We are developing CryptPad through the [OpenPaaS::NG](http://open-paas.org/) research project with the generous financing of the French state's Bank of Public Investments.

We are responsible for developing [Collaborative Real Time Editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_real-time_editor) for the project.
XWiki enjoys the ability to offer additional value to our users.
Beyond that, however, we in XWiki's research department want to advance the state of the art in this field.

## Why we care

With CryptPad, our goal is to advance the state of the art in a way that delivers tangible benefits to real users.

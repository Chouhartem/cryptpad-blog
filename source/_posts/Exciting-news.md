Here in the research department of XWiki SAS, which you may know as _the CryptPad team_, we take our work very seriously.
Each day of the week, we do our best to deliver features which will solve real problems for real users.
For a team of three full-time developers, that means covering a lot of ground.

* we correspond with users who report issues, to track down bugs and identify usability issues
* we write a lot, and not just code, but also documentation, technical reports for [our generous sponsors](http://open-paas.org/), and promotional materials so that more people can benefit from our software
* we take risks every day, building systems which others might have dismissed as impossible...

## Why we do it

We work to build new tools, because we recognize that the world around us is always changing.
We know that our users navigate new challenges all the time, and we want to be there to help.
Ultimately, we all share the same world, and we want to make the most of it.

We've put a lot of ourselves into this project, because we want to push the state of the art forward.
While it's a very small team that develops CryptPad directly, we couldn't do it without the support of [XWiki SAS](http://xwiki.com), and their willingness to take the risk of developing new technologies.
Currently, our funding covers only 50% of our expenses, but we've been confident that it would lead to better things in the future.

Which brings us to what we'd like to announce...

## Our new sponsors!

We've been offering up new features, which you've been noticing, and others have noticed that you've noticed.
Major industry players have taken an interest in what we've been doing, and they've decided to commit to _the Zero Knowledge Revolution_.

## What this means

Our hard work has paid off!
We're going to keep working on CryptPad, albeit with a little more security.

In exchange, we're going to work with our new partner (**hint**: they run a little search engine you may have heard of) to encrypt even more of your traffic.

Our team is going to expand from 3 full time developers, to 60.
This is going to give us more time to polish up some features we've been waiting to announce:

* offline support, so that you can continue to use pads with your friends, whether you have an internet connection or not
* total encryption, including metadata. Cryptpad will be completely anonymous, since it will be primarily offline, we won't have access to information about your location or activity
* full text search on encryped data, using quantum homomorphic encryption. Find everything all the time, in real time, with friends or alone
* All of this is going to become available under the more permissive _MIT License_. It will continue to be open source, but we hope this will drive more adoption in the business sector, even among enterprises which adhere to the _proprietary software_ business model

We've been preparing this deal for some time, but we haven't been able to talk about it while it was still under negotiation.
With most of that out of the way, we're very happy to be able to share this news with you!

There are still a few details to work out, but in the next few days we're going to announce more about our partnership. We still can't say their name, but we bet you can take a guess at who we're talking about.

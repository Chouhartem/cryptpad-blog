## üéÇ 10 Years since first commit
31st October 2024 marks 10 years since the first commit to the CryptPad codebase. The project has come a long way since then, when it was just an experimental single page "pad". The Drive was added in early 2017 with [v1.0.0](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.0.0) and the project gradually became a full office suite. We wish CryptPad another 10 years of development and improvement. <!-- new paragraph? --> To celebrate we are offering 50% off all plans on CryptPad.fr for the next couple of days, to redeem it please use the code `10YEARS` at checkout for any plan on CryptPad.fr until midnight on Friday Nov 1st (Paris time).

## üöß CryptPad.fr server migration
[We recently announced](https://fosstodon.org/@cryptpad/113366972887911954) some maintenance downtime to perform a storage migration for our flagship instance. Here are some more details about this for those who are interested:

Last winter we migrated the storage of our CryptPad.fr back-end server from an old LVM partitioning scheme to BTRFS. After encountering a variety of issues, complicating our maintenance tasks and even causing some serious downtime, we decided to switch to ZFS.

We took the opportunity to migrate the entire service to a new server, running Debian 12 instead of the outdated 10. With a much newer kernel and the latest OpenZFS version. After carefully planning this, we successfully completed the task on Tuesday, October 28th.

While it's too early to draw any conclusion regarding performance and reliability, we recognize it's an important step forward for our flagship CryptPad instance's future. Reducing our operating costs, the need for manual operations, improving the speed of running backups and at the same time, improving the experience for our users.

## ü§ù Can√≤drom collaboration

This month we announced the start of a [collaboration with  the Can√≤drom in Barcelona](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2024/10/15/canodrom-collab/). We will have more to say in the coming months on how this will actually work, but we are delighted to be associated with this laboratory connecting open-source software and the needs of citizens.

## Up next

- We will keep a close eye on the new storage of cryptpad.fr for performance and any issues
- The team is working towards our winter release expected for December

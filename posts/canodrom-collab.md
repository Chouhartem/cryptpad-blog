We're excited to announce a new collaboration between CryptPad and the Canòdrom, a unique space in Barcelona dedicated to exploring the intersection of technology and democracy. The Canòdrom is more than just a space—it's a citizen's laboratory for fostering open technologies, digital rights, and active civic participation. As a community-driven atheneum, it engages the local neighbourhood, the broader city, and even a global audience, bringing people together around shared values of openness, collaboration, and innovation.

At the heart of the Canòdrom's mission are critical topics like democracy, digital rights, and hack feminism. They also focus on digital culture, education, and the ecological impact of free technologies—areas where CryptPad's privacy-first, open-source ethos aligns perfectly.

This collaboration underscores our shared commitment to building a digital future that is transparent, inclusive, and respects users' autonomy and privacy. Through this collaboration, we are thrilled to join a dynamic ecosystem of forward-thinking projects like Decidim, Coopdevs, DataForGoodBCN, femProcomuns, FemDevs, and Tecnopolítica, among a lot of others. 

Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this exciting journey!

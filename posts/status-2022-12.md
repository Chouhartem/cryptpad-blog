## 🚀 New version (and fixes)

This month we released [CryptPad 5.2.0](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/5.2.0), introducing some new and long-requested features

### 📊 New Forms settings

- Submit multiple times and/or edit and delete past responses
- Notifications for form owners
- Form authors can delete all responses
- JSON export

The settings area was getting crowded, so we refactored them into a modal window with a summary in the main editor view.

### 🗓️ 🔁 Repeating Calendar events

We already [talked about this back in October](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2022/10/28/status-2022-10/) but the feature is now available to everyone.

- Quick default patterns (daily, weekly, etc)
- Custom patterns
- Edit this, future, or all events

### 🤝 Team drive on-boarding improvements

- Invite links can now be used a set number of times instead of only once
- Set the initial role for links instead of inviting everyone as viewer and promoting manually

### 🩹 Bug fixes

Following the release we identified a few bugs with help from the community. We released the fixes as [CryptPad 5.2.1](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/5.2.1).

## 🛡️ Bitwarden Open Source Security Summit

David did a quick presentation of CryptPad at the Open Source Security Summit 2022 organized by [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) on 8th December. The individual speaker videos should be available on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-IZTwAxWO4VMST3rtJTQPvNc277Xh1wW) in the coming weeks.

## 🔭 What's next

We are excited to welcome another team member first thing in the new year, a senior developer that we will introduce soon.

We are also looking forward to implementing some important new features next year, namely Single-Sign-On and Multi-factor authentication. We will be doing this thanks to a grant from [NLNet and NGI AUSSURE](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPad-Auth/). There will be much more information to come on this when the project starts.

## üåª CryptPad Summer release (2024.6.0)

The summer release is in production on CryptPad.fr and will soon be tagged on
GitHub.

This release primarily introduces our new onboarding system! We also include
some fixes on accessibility, deployment, OnlyOffice and more.

### üîõ Onboarding

We added an onboarding process when running CryptPad for the first time to help
administrators in the process of configuring their own instance.
Once the first admin account is created, the onboarding guides them to configure
the name, description, visual identity of the instance, which applications are
available, and enable extra security features. All these options can be changed
later on in the administration panel.

This will hopefully ease the installation process of new CryptPad instances.

### ‚ôø Accessibility

Following our effort in making CryptPad more accessible, some bugs have been
fixed with this release. In particular, if navigating with your keyboard, you
can access all the tabbable elements from a document or certain modals.

## üé¨ CryptPad at FOSS‚ÄØconferences feedbacks

In the past month, Fabrice has been traveling to different free and open-source
software-related conferences to present multiple aspects of CryptPad:

- ü¶Å [**Journ√©es du logiciel libre**](https://jdll.org/). This event took place
in Lyon, and the topic this year was ‚Äúpopular education‚Äù. That‚Äôs why a talk
about CryptPad for research and education was presented: CryptPad was shown as a
tool to spread information while safeguarding the privacy of the different
actors: both the writers and the readers. This privacy is guaranteed not only
against external threats, but also from _us_ (up to reasonable limits) and our
open-source policy ensures that anyone can double-check those claims.  
The talk was overall well-received and people were glad to discover that
CryptPad is more than just an end-to-end encrypted version of etherpad.
- üêá [**Pas sage en Seine**](https://passageenseine.fr/) is a privacy-oriented
event that covers a large spectrum of topics. This year Fabrice gave a general
presentation of CryptPad and its recent advances, such as
[Blueprints](https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/) or SSO integration.  
The public was quite interested and some people asked for a CryptPad
install-party to test the server installation process using docker, which was
thus organized. It was however before the integration of the onboarding process.
However, this initiative was a good opportunity to see how easy it is to install
CryptPad, and may lead in the future to smoother deployments.  
The talk was recorded and is available [here](https://video.passageenseine.fr/w/mGGr6xiySrRipaXes7zHN8) (in French).
- üêß [**OW2 conference**](https://www.ow2con.org/view/2024/). OW2 is a
consortium between FOSS actors and they organized a conference near Paris to
exchange about the new advances in the open-source community. There was also
some breakout sessions, with one about Research, Science and Education. It was
there that Fabrice gave a 15 minute speech about CryptPad for research and
education, where it fitted well in the session. During those two days, Fabrice
was also present at the CryptPad booth to answer the different questions about
CryptPad, its usage and, again, the installation process.

This was also relayed in the [XWiki
blog](https://xwiki.com/en/Blog/Events-April-to-June/), which CryptPad is part
of. There, you can find links for the different slidedecks.

## üî≠ Next up

- Andreea will join the team for an internship at the start of the month!
- We will start planning for the autumn release (`2024.9.0`)
- Fabrice will finish his conference tour at [Pass the
Salt](https://2024.pass-the-salt.org/) in Lille on Wednesday, July 3rd. He will
present [future improvements in
CryptPad](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/pts2024/talk/7HUMEU/)

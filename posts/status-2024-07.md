## 🚀 Bugfix release: 2024.6.1

[CryptPad 2024.6.1](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.6.1) is live on Cryptapd.fr and available on Github since a couple of days.

This is a bugfix release addressing some issues reported by users:

- Issues with calendar events not displaying without a page refresh
- OnlyOffice documents not opening
- Code/Markdown documents not printing

We also took the opportunity to enable new translations from the community: Español cubano, اَلْعَرَبِيَّةُ Arabic, Svenska, and to update the existing languages.

## 🧑‍🔬 Welcome Andreea

Andreea joined the team at the start of the month for a summer internship as part of the [Stagii pe Bune](https://stagiipebune.ro/home/) program in Romania. She is working with Wolfgang on our OnlyOffice integration.

At the beginning of the month, Fabrice presented **future advances** in
CryptPad at Pass the Salt 2024. It is a security conference that took place
in Lille and covering a large spectrum of topics, from hardware attacks to
letsencrypt emergency fallbacks while showing some reverse engineering
explorations.

The talk, well received by the attendees, presented the way CryptPad is built
around cryptography to ensure the data and identity privacy of its users. It
then continued on showing the results of the NLnet NGI0
[blueprints](https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/) project that finished in May
this year.

## 🔭 Up Next

- We are working towards the 🍁 Autumn release (`2024.9.0`) that we expect for late September (we will confirm the exact date, likely to be before or after the [XWiki Summit](https://download.xwiki.com/en/summit-2024/) and company-wide seminar happening at that time)
- The team is working on some experimental R&D prototypes to improve CryptPad's performance. We will detail these in upcoming blog posts and releases

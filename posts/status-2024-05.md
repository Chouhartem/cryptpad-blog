## ðŸš€ Minor release `2024.3.1`

This month we released [CryptPad 2024.3.1](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.3.1) with some improvements for OnlyOffice applications and various other fixes and translations. Please see the [full release notes](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/2024.3.1) for details.


## ðŸ§ª Blueprints R&D site launched

We are happy to announce that we completed the [CryptPad Blueprints](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPad-Blueprints/) project and launched [our Research & Development website](https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/) which we will be the home for all CryptPad related research going forward.

Blueprints is a project funded by [NGI Zero](https://nlnet.nl/NGI0/) by NLNet  to survey the state of the cryptography, ease of access of CryptPad, and propose some improvements. We already published [some of the ressources](https://blog.cryptpad.org/tags/blueprints/) on this blog, such as the [whitepaper](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2023/02/02/Whitepaper/) and a [good practices guide](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2024/03/14/Most-Secure-CryptPad-Usage/). However, these were just a fraction of the full research now accessible on [the blueprints website](https://blueprints.cryptpad.org/)

This website shows our analysis of CryptPad, a [user-stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) based needs analysis and their relations to proposed solutions (some of which are already live) as well as some prototyping of missing features such as password recovery or the use of <abbr title="Conflict-free Replicated Data Types">CRDTs</abbr> to pave the way toward offline-first editing.

We will maintain this website and update it when we conduct new research so expect to hear more about Blueprints in future!

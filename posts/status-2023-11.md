## üé™ Capitole du Libre

November 18 and 19, the _Capitole du Libre_ was held in Toulouse, France. It is an annual meeting for free and open ways enthusiasts.
During this event, Cryptpad was present on a stand that was quite well-received by curious attendees, as well as during two talks by Ludovic Dubost and Cl√©ment Aubin about [FOSS as a job](https://cfp.capitoledulibre.org/cdl-2023/talk/PWQ8UQ/) and [OpenDesk](https://cfp.capitoledulibre.org/cdl-2023/talk/GTQZDS/).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Videos should be online at some point in the future on the [Capitole du Libre YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCceC8Q8hThsWwmhqkjclcZg/videos).

## üì¨ Nextcloud integration

![screenshot of the Nextcloud application](/images/nextcloud-app.png)

Wolfgang has been hard at work on our Nextcloud application this month, receiving feedback and fixing issues. This [Open in CryptPad](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/openincryptpad) integration is part of [OpenDesk](https://xwiki.com/en/Blog/XWiki-joins-OpenDesk/). It provides encrypted real-time collaborative sessions on diagram documents stored on a Nextcloud instance. If this is of interest to you please check out the application in the Nextcloud app store and our [source code repository](https://github.com/cryptpad/nextcloud-open-in-cryptpad).

## üíå Still collecting testimonials
Quick reminder that we are still collecting nice words about why you love CryptPad through our [Testimonials Survey](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/1NDX7MEkhzNz1FCrcjCxmvjgIj24QjWNncZygR60Ch8/). We already have [lots of individual submissions](https://cryptpad.org/testimonials/) but please keep them coming. We are especially grateful if you are able to endorse our project on behalf of an organization, company, or institution.

## üè† Team news
Unfortunately Faye did not renew her contract with us after 6 months in the team. We are thankful for her contributions to CryptPad and wish her the very best on her future endeavors. 

## üî≠ What's next

- We are still at work on CryptPad 5.6 which we are hoping to release before the end of the year
- Looking ahead, we are thinking about next year's priorities. There's no doubt that improving our OnlyOffice integrations (esp. Document and Presentation) will be high on that list
- We're thinking about contributions to this blog beyond the monthly status, perhaps more tutorials, let us know if there is anything you would like us to cover!

We proudly present the [cryptography white paper](www.cryptpad.org/whitepaper)
summarizing the cryptography used in CryptPad.
The paper is targeted at people that are familiar with cryptography, but
obviously available for everyone interested in CryptPad.

In this white paper, we discuss CryptPad's underlying threat model, and explain
the communication between the server and the client.
We present the encryption of pads as the core functionality of CryptPad.
We further show how the login mechanism works and how we establish secure
communication between different users.
Finally, we show how we enable communication and access control within a team.

This white paper is part of the [CryptPad Blueprints
Project](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPad-Blueprints/) and was founded through
the [NGI0 Entrust Fund](https://nlnet.nl/entrust). We thank
[NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) for their support.

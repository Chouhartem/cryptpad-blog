## ⛰️ Over 270K accounts on CryptPad.fr
We are happy to report that registered users on our flagship instance have passed the 270,000 mark. This follows steady growth of about 1 thousand registrations a week. While it demonstrates interest in our product, we will need to convert more of these users to [subscribers](https://cryptpad.fr/accounts/#) or [donations](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad) to make the project financially sustainable.

## 🧪 End-to-end test suite published
After months of work by Zuzanna on an end-to-end test suite for CryptPad, we are [publishing the results on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptpad/e2e-test-suite). This will make our quality assurance process more transparent and might even encourage people with knowledge of [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to contribute.

## 🐋 🇫🇷 French Docker tutorial 
We came across a [great blog post at Belginux](https://belginux.com/installer-cryptpad-avec-docker/) that details the process of installing CryptPad with Docker.

## 🔭 Next up
- The team is hard at work on the Summer release cycle 
- A lot of the focus is now on OnlyOffice applications through the France 2030 project which we will write more about in future. This is long-haul work that not pay off instantly but is really needed to improve the stability of the OnlyOffice integrations
- We have interviewed some candidates for summer internships and have made an offer. We will post more details if/when it is accepted

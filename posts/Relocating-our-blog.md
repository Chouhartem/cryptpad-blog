This is just a quick announcement to say that we've moved our blog from **blog.cryptpad.fr** to **blog.cryptpad.org**. Visitors to the old URL will be automatically redirected to the new one. Anyone who has subscribed to its RSS feed will continue to get updates for the new address.

This blog is the first of a few services that we plan to host under the _CryptPad.org_ domain. Our goal is to provide some better separation between _CryptPad_ (the open-source project) and _CryptPad.fr_ (the public instance that we host). In the near future we plan to introduce a project website featuring general information, an overview of our roadmap and finances, and a directory of public instances.

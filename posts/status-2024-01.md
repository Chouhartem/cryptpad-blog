## 🚀 CryptPad 5.7.0

This release includes some features that could not be included into 5.6.0, namely instance invitations and support for images in diagrams. It also includes bug fixes in the drive, calendar and many other places.


### 📇 Invitation links and user directory

Instance administrators can now issue invitation links that can be used to create one account each, even if registration is closed on the instance. An optional User Directory can help keep track of the known accounts on the instance. This feature is designed for the needs of enterprise customers who use their own instance, hence allowing administrators access to more information than on a public-facing service 

### 🖼️ Support for images in the Diagram app

Diagram documents now support embedding images.

5.7.0 also includes a lot of bug fixes and improvements. See the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/cryptpad/cryptpad/releases/tag/5.7.0) for the full list.

After seven years of contributing to CryptPad's code and having led the project since 2018, I have decided that it is time for me to take a step back to pursue some new goals.
I plan to take an extended holiday, after which I'll focus on growing my practice as an independent privacy and security researcher.

Not that long ago we had to try convince people just to test the platform.
Now, I've lost track of all the times its usage doubled or more overnight, leaving us scrambling to solve new scaling issues.
I am truly grateful that I had the opportunity to be a part of this journey and to have spent this time alongside some fantastic colleagues.

Going forward the team will be led by David, who you may have known up until now as our design lead.
Since 2019, David has been the bridge between our users' needs and the platform's engineering requirements.
That design work is at the core of our mission - to make privacy and encryption accessible to a much broader audience - and I am confident the team will thrive as it begins this new chapter.

I will remain on the team for a few more months to ensure that this transition happens smoothly, but naturally, David will have the support of the rest of the team.
Yann has been a part of CryptPad since the very beginning, well before I moved from Canada to France to join the effort.
Mathilde has taken on the role of platform administrator and community organizer since the summer.
We will have a new member joining in January, and there are still [open positions on the team](https://cryptpad.org/jobs/) which you might be able to fill.
I am leaving the project in excellent hands.

And of course, CryptPad is not just the product of our team's work, but also the sum of many contributions from the wider community.
I'm very thankful for the support of our past and present funders from BPI France, Mozilla, members of Europe's NGI initiative, subscribers on CryptPad.fr, and everyone who has donated to our [OpenCollective campaign](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#category-CONTRIBUTE).

Once again, thank you to all of you who helped make these last seven years what they were, and have a great 2023!

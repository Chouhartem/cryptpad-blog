if\nwe're going to hack ourselves out of a situation that nobody really wants to be in,\nwe're going to need to understand them pretty well.\n \n* Why is Open Source habitually *90% of the way there* ?\n* Why is Facebook more addictive than it is useful ?\n* Why is it that when you get something for free, even from a well funded\ngovernment program, it's reliably worse than something you buy?\n \nIt's all about incentives.\n \n### In a restaurant, you're the customer\n \nI love going to restaurants. I have no car and few possessions so restaurants are\nthe way I spend my income. Not only do I love food but I love the relationship\nwhich I have with restaurateurs. When I walk into a restaurant, I want to be fed\ndelicious food and they want to be paid, not only that, they want me to be happy\nso I will return many times and bring my friends. I want them to be happy so they\nwill give me bigger portions and maybe a little dessert on the house. Our\nincentives are aligned perfectly. We are practically a team.\n\n### In a soup kitchen, you're just a user\n\nIt is hard to deny the importance of soup kitchens to the fabric of society.\nPart of what makes us able to claim to be civilized is the fact that we don't let\npeople simply die if they're down on their luck. Soup kitchens, however, are not\nrestaurants. When you walk into a soup kitchen, you are generally greeted kindly\nbut there is a subtle distinction from a restaurant, at a restaurant you're the\ncustomer and at a soup kitchen you're just a *user*. Many soup kitchens are\norganized around religious groups and  evangelizing their belief is a significant\npart of their motivation, but even secular organizations are motivated by some\nsort of a higher calling.\n\n### Open Source is a soup kitchen\n\nI've been developing Open Source both professionally and personally for 7 years\nand I'm going to tell you something that many Open Source developers won't admit.\nOpen Source software is not made for you. Sometimes Open Source developers are\nmotivated by the Free Software ideology and they imagine their code as\ntransforming the world, sometimes they just want to solve some problem for\nthemselves and they give away the resulting code. Open Source software is almost\nnever developed for the simple purpose of making another person's life a little\neasier.\n \n## If you aren't the customer you're the product\n \nThis aphorism has become popular with the rise of ad-tech and social network\nwebsites. The phrase invokes an image of free services coming like free grain\nbecause you are, in fact, the pig on his way to slaughter. In some way this is\ntrue, Silicon Valley business models are becoming disturbingly like human\nfarming.\n\nHowever, the phrase also invokes an image of an evil entrepreneur plotting to\nenslave humanity by creating a slick social network. If 1 in 1000 companies is\nsuccessful then logic implies there must be thousands of evil entrepreneurs\nrunning around everywhere. If this is true then where are all of the failed\nevil plotters? I've never met an entrepreneur who was anything less than an\naspiring saint.\n \nI think the real reason why social networks become human farms is because people\ndon't want to pay for development of web services and stuck between a successful\nhuman farm and a failing soup kitchen, entrepreneurs begrudgingly choose to farm.\n \n## Breaking out\n \nIf we're ever going to stop living in a world of farms and soup kitchens, we're\ngoing to need to get serious about incentives. Part of my intention in starting\nthe CryptPad project is to build something that is not a farm nor a soup kitchen.\nI want to have a mutually beneficial relationship with every one of CryptPad's\nusers, including you. I don't want to be a charity worker beholden to an NGO or\na post office clerk drawing a paycheck from the state.

In the development time this donated money\nbuys, we will pay special consideration to the needs of CryptPad admins like you.</li>\n<li>Share the revenue: If you specify some configuration parameters and send us\nan <a href=\"mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">email</a>, the donation button will become an\n<em>Upgrade Account</em> button, allowing them to take a plan with additional storage\nquota. When people upgrade their account on your server, we will credit you 50%\nof the revenue earned. This helps us pay the cost of development and helps you\npay the cost of hosting.</li>\n<li>Disable the donate button: If you do this, we hope you will help CryptPad in\nsome other way such as by taking an on-premises support contract.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you run a public CryptPad instance, please don’t increase the 50MB per user\nstorage limit. This limit is what makes people subscribe and what pays for\nCryptPad development. Running a CryptPad instance which offers a “better deal”\nis effectively using the project against itself.</p>\n<p>Finally, new versions of CryptPad always check for new or expired accounts from\nour account server. We have added a parameter called <em>adminEmail</em> which will be\nsent along with the domain and version of CryptPad you’re running. This way we\ncan notify you if we’re aware of any a serious problems with your CryptPad\ninstance. We take your privacy seriously and will never sell your email or send\nyou marketing spam. If, however, you want to keep your CryptPad instance\ncompletely  hidden from us, you can set this parameter to <strong>false</strong> and it will\nnever query the account server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Coming-next\"><a href=\"#Coming-next\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Coming next\"></a>Coming next</h2><p>Our objective is to help you collaborate, stay organized and get things done\nfaster and easier. We want to provide maximum value to you and we want you to\nprovide value to us so that we can continue doing it. As was said in the\nprevious post, the big issues which we are planning to tackle soon are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>File upload for PDF and image embedding</li>\n<li>Text coloring based on the authors of the document</li>\n<li>Workgroups for team collaboration</li>\n<li>Zero Knowledge spreadsheets</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As always, we will be continuing to put great effort into understanding your\nproblems, how you go about solving them, and how we can make little changes to\nmake CryptPad fit your needs better.</p>\n<p>Caleb</p>\n"},{"title":"CryptPad Funding Status July 2020","date":"2020-07-03T12:34:09.000Z","author":"Ludovic Dubost","_content":"\nWe have not been very active on the CryptPad blog lately, however, we have been very active making [new releases to CryptPad](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/).\n\nWe have also published some news about our funding on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#section-updates) and in particular the [July 2020 funding status article](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/updates/cryptpad-funding-status-july-2020).\n\nLudovic, for the CryptPad team.\n","source":"_posts/CryptPad-Funding-Status-July-2020.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CryptPad Funding Status July 2020\ndate: 2020-07-03 18:04:09\nauthor: Ludovic Dubost\ntags:\n  - funding\n  - open collective\n  - donate\n---\n\nWe have not been very active on the CryptPad blog lately, however, we have been very active making [new releases to CryptPad](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/).\n\nWe have also published some news about our funding on our [Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#section-updates) and in particular the [July 2020 funding status article](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/updates/cryptpad-funding-status-july-2020).\n\nLudovic, for the CryptPad team.\n","slug":"CryptPad-Funding-Status-July-2020","published":1,"updated":"2020-07-03T18:41:52.097Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cktsjy9tm0002cya8xaw2eq1a","content":"<p>We have not been very active on the CryptPad blog lately, however, we have been very active making <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new releases to CryptPad</a>.</p>\n<p>We have also published some news about our funding on our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#section-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Collective page</a> and in particular the <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/updates/cryptpad-funding-status-july-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 2020 funding status article</a>.</p>\n<p>Ludovic, for the CryptPad team.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<p>We have not been very active on the CryptPad blog lately, however, we have been very active making <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new releases to CryptPad</a>.</p>\n<p>We have also published some news about our funding on our <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad#section-updates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open Collective page</a> and in particular the <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/updates/cryptpad-funding-status-july-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">July 2020 funding status article</a>.</p>\n<p>Ludovic, for the CryptPad team.</p>\n"},{"title":"CryptPad Jackalope - File Upload, PDF and Pictures","date":"2017-06-21T07:18:48.000Z","author":"Caleb James DeLisle","_content":"\nYesterday we released CryptPad v1.9.0 Jackalope, we have some exciting new features\nwhich we've been working on for a long time.

part of the [OpenPaaS::NG research project](http://ng.open-paas.org/). Since then it has developed into a suite of editors for many different types of documents, all without ever leaking the content that you edit to the server or the server operators. Now, in order to keep the project moving, we need your help.\n\nWe have created a roadmap of the features which we would like to develop over the next year and **we're hoping to raise 60,000€** to finance it. Fortunately, **XWiki SAS is willing to match your donations euro-for-euro**. XWiki SAS is a company with open source at its heart and it was the company where CryptPad was first envisioned. XWiki SAS normally sells days of development time at about 1,000€ each, but since this project is dear to our hearts, we are also discounting the structure costs (things like the office and business taxes) for this project. **We believe in CryptPad, but in order to succeed, we need you to believe in it too**.\n\nThe following is a 48 week roadmap which will fund one developer to work on CryptPad. You can donate to this roadmap on https://opencollective.com/cryptpad or on https://accounts.cryptpad.fr/#/donate, if you would like to make a donation by wire transfer or by cryptocurrency, please get in touch with us at [sales@cryptpad.fr](mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr) and if you are involved in EU research projects and would like to work with us and this cutting edge Privacy Enhancing Technology, please contact [research@xwiki.com](mailto:research@xwiki.com).\n\n# Goal 1 - Spreadsheets & Office Documents\nCryptPad is excellent for quick editing of meeting notes and plans, and it is able to store and view images and PDF files, but it does not allow editing of more complex types of files such as spreadsheets and word documents. Fortunately there is an open source web-based editor called OnlyOffice which allows editing these complex document types, but it is a highly complex piece of software and we will need time and effort to integrate it into CryptPad. Even after it is fully integrated, the conversion of xlsx files to OnlyOffice's internal format will still need to be carried out be specialized software either on the user's computer, or on a cloud service (not Zero-Knowledge!). However, we think that editing of spreadsheets and other documents in OnlyOffice is achievable without leaking any of the content back to the CryptPad server, so your spreadsheets will remain a secret.\n\n* Spreadsheets, documents and presentations in CryptPad\n* Realtime collaborative editing of office documents\n* No import/export for now, this will come later\n* No embedding of images from CryptPad until later\n\nWe expect office file editing will take **30 days, a cost of €7,500**\n\n# Goal 2 - Comments on Rich Text Pads\nMany people use a workflow which includes the use of comments in a document. This is already standard in Google Docs and we need to be able to support it in CryptPad, in order to add comments we will need to add some HTML into the document without causing any problems for CKEditor (our rich text editor) and without causing it to be treated as part of the pad and synced over the wire.\n\n* In the rich text pad, you will be able to add a comment by selecting some text, right clicking it and clicking \"add comment\"\n* Comments will be shown in the right margin and associated with the text which highlighted them\n* Comments will be able to be replied to, or \"resolved\" (they will no longer be shown, but still be visible in history of the document)\n* If you delete the text with which a comment was associated, the comment will automatically be resolved\n\nWe expect Comments on Rich Text Pads to take about **10 days of development, a cost of €2,500**\n\n# Goal 3 - Contacts and Messaging\nTo be able to easily share documents and get the attention of a person, we would like to implement Contacts and Messaging in CryptPad, currently we have a rudimentry implementation which allows chatting with contacts, but the contact request feature needs to be stabilized with a better process for contact requests, better integration with pad-sharing menu and more clear notifications. We would also like to add a small chat window in each document so that everyone working on that document can chat about it. Finally, we would like to add the ability to at-reference someone when writing a comment on a pad, which will cause a message to be sent to them.\n\n* The share menu will include a list of contacts with whom you can share the pad\n* You will be able to email somebody a link which will invite them to become a contact of yours\n* Messages (pads shared with you, comments referencing you) will be shown in the upper-right when you come to CryptPad\n* When writing a comment (Goal 2), you will be able to at-reference a contact (with auto-complete) and they will be notified\n* Replying to (and resolving) a comment will also cause the author of the comment and anyone who replied to be notified\n\nWe expect Contacts and Messaging to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 4 - Shared Drive\nWhen planning a significant project, often there is the need to have many pads for the different aspects of the project. Currently all of the collaborators on the project must share all of the pad links with each other and they must each organize them in their personal drives. Personal drive organization is a nice feature because it allows each person to organize their work the way that makes the most sense to them, but sometimes it is more advantageous to have a folder in everybody's drive which contains pads that are shared between all of them.\n\nShared folders are complicated to implement. Unlike your personal drive which is just one realtime object (essentially it's a pad), each shared folder must be a separate realtime object. Also, like a user account, a shared folder must be able to own pads, otherwise pads in that folder which are not in anyone's personal drive risk being deleted by the server as per our expiration policy.\n\n* You will be able to create a shared drive, just like you create a pad\n* In your drive, you will be able to explore inside of the shared drive and organize it just like a folder\n* You will be able to share the link to the Shared Drive with other people, when they click the link, it will import the shared drive into their personal drive\n\nWe expect Shared Drive to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 5 - Federated Messaging\nThere are about 150 CryptPad instances in existence, operated by people and organizations who want the privacy which CryptPad offers and also the additional security guarantee, decentralization and customization of their own instance. We want to support this usage while still allowing people on one instance to chat and message people on another instance. We want to support the ability to add contacts (Goal 3) with people registered on a different instance. You will then be able to at-reference them in a comment or share a pad with them using the share menu as you would with a person using the same instance as you.\n\n* When you are on a pad or shared folder on somebody else's instance, you will be able to import it to your instance\n* Clicking a link to become a contact will work, even if you are registered on a different instance\n* Once you have made a contact, all features in Contacts and Messaging will function across instances\n\nWe expect Federated Messaging to take about **30 days of development, a cost of €7,500**\n\n# Goal 6 - Better permissions\nInitially, all pads were \"open\" pads, meaning they were accessible to anyone and there was no owner. Open pads are deleted automatically when they have not been touched in 3 months, unless a registered user has a reference to them. Once we added the ability to have registered users, we needed to make sure that users would not have the pads in their drive disappear off the server, so we implemented what we call pinning. Pinning is a way of claiming that a pad is important to you and that it should not be deleted. However, this left a problem, still pads had no owner, meaning nobody had the right to delete them. Once a pad was created, there was no way to delete it which was a serious problem for pads contining confidential information.\n\nIn order to allow pads to be deleted, we implemented _owned pads_, and the splash screen registered users now see when they create a new pad. So now you can delete it from the server when you are done with it. However, two problems remain:\n\n1. The owner of a pad is the person who created it and there is no way to add owners or share ownership\n2. There is no way to revoke access once it has been given\n\nIn order to solve #1, we will add the ability to share ownership with other people. For solving #2 in a Zero-Knowledge compatible way, we will need to introduce the concept of redirects, links which re-direct to the actual ID and key of the pad. Revoking access will be a matter of changing the pad's ID and then updating all of the redirects which are *not* to be revoked. This will allow the creation of pads which can only be viewed by registered users who are invited. Even view-only links to a pad will be able to be revoked by the owners of that pad.\n\n* Pads which are only accessible by people invited, or members of a group\n* Grant and revoke access\n* Create new links to a pad, and revoke them\n\nWe expect better permissions will take about **40 days of development, a cost of €10,000**\n\n# Goal 7 - Color-by-author\nAfter something is typed into a pad, the person who typed cannot be determined, we would like to change this and allow the etherpad-like behavior of shading the text differently based on who typed it. This will require getting the author from each patch in the stream of changes to the pad and making it available to the pad structure. In CryptPad there is a special message type which is called a checkpoint, it replaces the entire pad so that when a new person arrives in the pad, they don't need to download more history than the previous 2 checkpoints. We will need to take special care to preserve the editor of each piece of the document when we create checkpoints, finally we will need to be able to shade the text based on it's author, without either messing up CKEditor or causing the shading to be sent over the wire as if it were part of the pad.\n\n* When an option is selected, text in the rich text app will be shaded with a color based on the author of that text\n* The user list will show users who have joined and then left again, along with the color of their changes\n* Right-clicking on the text will show the name of the person who wrote it (including whether they are one of your contacts)\n\nWe expect Color-by-author to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 8 - Offline and Suggested Edits\nLike color-by-author, Offline and Suggested Edits is a reasonably complicated feature to implement. When working on a complex document, it is nice to be able to propose a change without actually changing the document, or make a change while disconnected from the internet and then have someone (maybe you) merge it later. However, this is complicated because when it comes time to merge that change, the document may have significantly changed, necessitating a smart merge.\n\nRich text pads in CryptPad are stored in a quazi-html representation so patching and merging is anything but simple. The operational transformation done normally on pads takes advantage of the fact that divergences are small and infrequent so merging usually works ok. This feature will require development of a smart merging algorithm for the rich text app as well as for any other app for which one would like to have suggested edits and offline.\n\n* Suggestion mode, your change is shown shaded and can be accepted or rejected, it will be attached to a comment so you can explain it\n* When offline, you are automatically put into suggestion mode instead of read-only mode\n\nWe expect Offline and Suggested Edits to take **40 days of development, a cost of €10,000**\n\n# Goal 9 - All the little things\nEven though it doesn't get a lot of press, a significant amount of time is spent just fixing bugs, handling pull requests and doing releases. We want to keep CryptPad a community project and so we want to make sure that when someone makes a pull-request to the project, that request can be properly handled. Also, because CryptPad makes such use of modern HTML5 features, new releases of Chrome and Firefox typically introduce new bugs in CryptPad. There is rarely enough time to handle all of the issues which crop up, but we need to allocate time to handle some of them. This roadmap allocates the time of one person for 48 weeks, which means 24 releases, we need at least 1 day per release just to perform the release and write the release notes and fix miscellanious issues which appear.\n\n* Keep on fixing bugs in CryptPad \n* Handle pull requests and make releases\n\nWe expect all the little things to take **30 days of development, a cost of €7,500**\n","source":"_posts/CryptPad-Roadmap.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CryptPad Roadmap\ndate: 2018-07-13 12:41:04\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - roadmap\n  - funding\n---\nCryptPad was started as an experimental platform as part of the [OpenPaaS::NG research project](http://ng.open-paas.org/). Since then it has developed into a suite of editors for many different types of documents, all without ever leaking the content that you edit to the server or the server operators. Now, in order to keep the project moving, we need your help.\n\nWe have created a roadmap of the features which we would like to develop over the next year and **we're hoping to raise 60,000€** to finance it. Fortunately, **XWiki SAS is willing to match your donations euro-for-euro**. XWiki SAS is a company with open source at its heart and it was the company where CryptPad was first envisioned. XWiki SAS normally sells days of development time at about 1,000€ each, but since this project is dear to our hearts, we are also discounting the structure costs (things like the office and business taxes) for this project. **We believe in CryptPad, but in order to succeed, we need you to believe in it too**.\n\nThe following is a 48 week roadmap which will fund one developer to work on CryptPad. You can donate to this roadmap on https://opencollective.com/cryptpad or on https://accounts.cryptpad.fr/#/donate, if you would like to make a donation by wire transfer or by cryptocurrency, please get in touch with us at [sales@cryptpad.fr](mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr) and if you are involved in EU research projects and would like to work with us and this cutting edge Privacy Enhancing Technology, please contact [research@xwiki.com](mailto:research@xwiki.com).\n\n# Goal 1 - Spreadsheets & Office Documents\nCryptPad is excellent for quick editing of meeting notes and plans, and it is able to store and view images and PDF files, but it does not allow editing of more complex types of files such as spreadsheets and word documents. Fortunately there is an open source web-based editor called OnlyOffice which allows editing these complex document types, but it is a highly complex piece of software and we will need time and effort to integrate it into CryptPad. Even after it is fully integrated, the conversion of xlsx files to OnlyOffice's internal format will still need to be carried out be specialized software either on the user's computer, or on a cloud service (not Zero-Knowledge!). However, we think that editing of spreadsheets and other documents in OnlyOffice is achievable without leaking any of the content back to the CryptPad server, so your spreadsheets will remain a secret.\n\n* Spreadsheets, documents and presentations in CryptPad\n* Realtime collaborative editing of office documents\n* No import/export for now, this will come later\n* No embedding of images from CryptPad until later\n\nWe expect office file editing will take **30 days, a cost of €7,500**\n\n# Goal 2 - Comments on Rich Text Pads\nMany people use a workflow which includes the use of comments in a document. This is already standard in Google Docs and we need to be able to support it in CryptPad, in order to add comments we will need to add some HTML into the document without causing any problems for CKEditor (our rich text editor) and without causing it to be treated as part of the pad and synced over the wire.\n\n* In the rich text pad, you will be able to add a comment by selecting some text, right clicking it and clicking \"add comment\"\n* Comments will be shown in the right margin and associated with the text which highlighted them\n* Comments will be able to be replied to, or \"resolved\" (they will no longer be shown, but still be visible in history of the document)\n* If you delete the text with which a comment was associated, the comment will automatically be resolved\n\nWe expect Comments on Rich Text Pads to take about **10 days of development, a cost of €2,500**\n\n# Goal 3 - Contacts and Messaging\nTo be able to easily share documents and get the attention of a person, we would like to implement Contacts and Messaging in CryptPad, currently we have a rudimentry implementation which allows chatting with contacts, but the contact request feature needs to be stabilized with a better process for contact requests, better integration with pad-sharing menu and more clear notifications. We would also like to add a small chat window in each document so that everyone working on that document can chat about it. Finally, we would like to add the ability to at-reference someone when writing a comment on a pad, which will cause a message to be sent to them.\n\n* The share menu will include a list of contacts with whom you can share the pad\n* You will be able to email somebody a link which will invite them to become a contact of yours\n* Messages (pads shared with you, comments referencing you) will be shown in the upper-right when you come to CryptPad\n* When writing a comment (Goal 2), you will be able to at-reference a contact (with auto-complete) and they will be notified\n* Replying to (and resolving) a comment will also cause the author of the comment and anyone who replied to be notified\n\nWe expect Contacts and Messaging to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 4 - Shared Drive\nWhen planning a significant project, often there is the need to have many pads for the different aspects of the project. Currently all of the collaborators on the project must share all of the pad links with each other and they must each organize them in their personal drives. Personal drive organization is a nice feature because it allows each person to organize their work the way that makes the most sense to them, but sometimes it is more advantageous to have a folder in everybody's drive which contains pads that are shared between all of them.\n\nShared folders are complicated to implement. Unlike your personal drive which is just one realtime object (essentially it's a pad), each shared folder must be a separate realtime object. Also, like a user account, a shared folder must be able to own pads, otherwise pads in that folder which are not in anyone's personal drive risk being deleted by the server as per our expiration policy.\n\n* You will be able to create a shared drive, just like you create a pad\n* In your drive, you will be able to explore inside of the shared drive and organize it just like a folder\n* You will be able to share the link to the Shared Drive with other people, when they click the link, it will import the shared drive into their personal drive\n\nWe expect Shared Drive to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 5 - Federated Messaging\nThere are about 150 CryptPad instances in existence, operated by people and organizations who want the privacy which CryptPad offers and also the additional security guarantee, decentralization and customization of their own instance. We want to support this usage while still allowing people on one instance to chat and message people on another instance. We want to support the ability to add contacts (Goal 3) with people registered on a different instance. You will then be able to at-reference them in a comment or share a pad with them using the share menu as you would with a person using the same instance as you.\n\n* When you are on a pad or shared folder on somebody else's instance, you will be able to import it to your instance\n* Clicking a link to become a contact will work, even if you are registered on a different instance\n* Once you have made a contact, all features in Contacts and Messaging will function across instances\n\nWe expect Federated Messaging to take about **30 days of development, a cost of €7,500**\n\n# Goal 6 - Better permissions\nInitially, all pads were \"open\" pads, meaning they were accessible to anyone and there was no owner. Open pads are deleted automatically when they have not been touched in 3 months, unless a registered user has a reference to them. Once we added the ability to have registered users, we needed to make sure that users would not have the pads in their drive disappear off the server, so we implemented what we call pinning. Pinning is a way of claiming that a pad is important to you and that it should not be deleted. However, this left a problem, still pads had no owner, meaning nobody had the right to delete them. Once a pad was created, there was no way to delete it which was a serious problem for pads contining confidential information.\n\nIn order to allow pads to be deleted, we implemented _owned pads_, and the splash screen registered users now see when they create a new pad. So now you can delete it from the server when you are done with it. However, two problems remain:\n\n1. The owner of a pad is the person who created it and there is no way to add owners or share ownership\n2. There is no way to revoke access once it has been given\n\nIn order to solve #1, we will add the ability to share ownership with other people. For solving #2 in a Zero-Knowledge compatible way, we will need to introduce the concept of redirects, links which re-direct to the actual ID and key of the pad. Revoking access will be a matter of changing the pad's ID and then updating all of the redirects which are *not* to be revoked. This will allow the creation of pads which can only be viewed by registered users who are invited. Even view-only links to a pad will be able to be revoked by the owners of that pad.\n\n* Pads which are only accessible by people invited, or members of a group\n* Grant and revoke access\n* Create new links to a pad, and revoke them\n\nWe expect better permissions will take about **40 days of development, a cost of €10,000**\n\n# Goal 7 - Color-by-author\nAfter something is typed into a pad, the person who typed cannot be determined, we would like to change this and allow the etherpad-like behavior of shading the text differently based on who typed it. This will require getting the author from each patch in the stream of changes to the pad and making it available to the pad structure. In CryptPad there is a special message type which is called a checkpoint, it replaces the entire pad so that when a new person arrives in the pad, they don't need to download more history than the previous 2 checkpoints. We will need to take special care to preserve the editor of each piece of the document when we create checkpoints, finally we will need to be able to shade the text based on it's author, without either messing up CKEditor or causing the shading to be sent over the wire as if it were part of the pad.\n\n* When an option is selected, text in the rich text app will be shaded with a color based on the author of that text\n* The user list will show users who have joined and then left again, along with the color of their changes\n* Right-clicking on the text will show the name of the person who wrote it (including whether they are one of your contacts)\n\nWe expect Color-by-author to take about **20 days of development, a cost of €5,000**\n\n# Goal 8 - Offline and Suggested Edits\nLike color-by-author, Offline and Suggested Edits is a reasonably complicated feature to implement. When working on a complex document, it is nice to be able to propose a change without actually changing the document, or make a change while disconnected from the internet and then have someone (maybe you) merge it later. However, this is complicated because when it comes time to merge that change, the document may have significantly changed, necessitating a smart merge.\n\nRich text pads in CryptPad are stored in a quazi-html representation so patching and merging is anything but simple. The operational transformation done normally on pads takes advantage of the fact that divergences are small and infrequent so merging usually works ok. This feature will require development of a smart merging algorithm for the rich text app as well as for any other app for which one would like to have suggested edits and offline.\n\n* Suggestion mode, your change is shown shaded and can be accepted or rejected, it will be attached to a comment so you can explain it\n* When offline, you are automatically put into suggestion mode instead of read-only mode\n\nWe expect Offline and Suggested Edits to take **40 days of development, a cost of €10,000**\n\n# Goal 9 - All the little things\nEven though it doesn't get a lot of press, a significant amount of time is spent just fixing bugs, handling pull requests and doing releases.

Since then it has developed into a suite of editors for many different types of documents, all without ever leaking the content that you edit to the server or the server operators. Now, in order to keep the project moving, we need your help.</p>\n<p>We have created a roadmap of the features which we would like to develop over the next year and <strong>we’re hoping to raise 60,000€</strong> to finance it. Fortunately, <strong>XWiki SAS is willing to match your donations euro-for-euro</strong>. XWiki SAS is a company with open source at its heart and it was the company where CryptPad was first envisioned. XWiki SAS normally sells days of development time at about 1,000€ each, but since this project is dear to our hearts, we are also discounting the structure costs (things like the office and business taxes) for this project. <strong>We believe in CryptPad, but in order to succeed, we need you to believe in it too</strong>.</p>\n<p>The following is a 48 week roadmap which will fund one developer to work on CryptPad. You can donate to this roadmap on <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://opencollective.com/cryptpad</a> or on <a href=\"https://accounts.cryptpad.fr/#/donate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://accounts.cryptpad.fr/#/donate</a>, if you would like to make a donation by wire transfer or by cryptocurrency, please get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sales@cryptpad.fr</a> and if you are involved in EU research projects and would like to work with us and this cutting edge Privacy Enhancing Technology, please contact <a href=\"mailto:research@xwiki.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">research@xwiki.com</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-1-Spreadsheets-amp-Office-Documents\"><a href=\"#Goal-1-Spreadsheets-amp-Office-Documents\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 1 - Spreadsheets &amp; Office Documents\"></a>Goal 1 - Spreadsheets &amp; Office Documents</h1><p>CryptPad is excellent for quick editing of meeting notes and plans, and it is able to store and view images and PDF files, but it does not allow editing of more complex types of files such as spreadsheets and word documents. Fortunately there is an open source web-based editor called OnlyOffice which allows editing these complex document types, but it is a highly complex piece of software and we will need time and effort to integrate it into CryptPad. Even after it is fully integrated, the conversion of xlsx files to OnlyOffice’s internal format will still need to be carried out be specialized software either on the user’s computer, or on a cloud service (not Zero-Knowledge!). However, we think that editing of spreadsheets and other documents in OnlyOffice is achievable without leaking any of the content back to the CryptPad server, so your spreadsheets will remain a secret.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spreadsheets, documents and presentations in CryptPad</li>\n<li>Realtime collaborative editing of office documents</li>\n<li>No import/export for now, this will come later</li>\n<li>No embedding of images from CryptPad until later</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect office file editing will take <strong>30 days, a cost of €7,500</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-2-Comments-on-Rich-Text-Pads\"><a href=\"#Goal-2-Comments-on-Rich-Text-Pads\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 2 - Comments on Rich Text Pads\"></a>Goal 2 - Comments on Rich Text Pads</h1><p>Many people use a workflow which includes the use of comments in a document. This is already standard in Google Docs and we need to be able to support it in CryptPad, in order to add comments we will need to add some HTML into the document without causing any problems for CKEditor (our rich text editor) and without causing it to be treated as part of the pad and synced over the wire.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In the rich text pad, you will be able to add a comment by selecting some text, right clicking it and clicking “add comment”</li>\n<li>Comments will be shown in the right margin and associated with the text which highlighted them</li>\n<li>Comments will be able to be replied to, or “resolved” (they will no longer be shown, but still be visible in history of the document)</li>\n<li>If you delete the text with which a comment was associated, the comment will automatically be resolved</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Comments on Rich Text Pads to take about <strong>10 days of development, a cost of €2,500</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-3-Contacts-and-Messaging\"><a href=\"#Goal-3-Contacts-and-Messaging\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 3 - Contacts and Messaging\"></a>Goal 3 - Contacts and Messaging</h1><p>To be able to easily share documents and get the attention of a person, we would like to implement Contacts and Messaging in CryptPad, currently we have a rudimentry implementation which allows chatting with contacts, but the contact request feature needs to be stabilized with a better process for contact requests, better integration with pad-sharing menu and more clear notifications. We would also like to add a small chat window in each document so that everyone working on that document can chat about it. Finally, we would like to add the ability to at-reference someone when writing a comment on a pad, which will cause a message to be sent to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The share menu will include a list of contacts with whom you can share the pad</li>\n<li>You will be able to email somebody a link which will invite them to become a contact of yours</li>\n<li>Messages (pads shared with you, comments referencing you) will be shown in the upper-right when you come to CryptPad</li>\n<li>When writing a comment (Goal 2), you will be able to at-reference a contact (with auto-complete) and they will be notified</li>\n<li>Replying to (and resolving) a comment will also cause the author of the comment and anyone who replied to be notified</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Contacts and Messaging to take about <strong>20 days of development, a cost of €5,000</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-4-Shared-Drive\"><a href=\"#Goal-4-Shared-Drive\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 4 - Shared Drive\"></a>Goal 4 - Shared Drive</h1><p>When planning a significant project, often there is the need to have many pads for the different aspects of the project. Currently all of the collaborators on the project must share all of the pad links with each other and they must each organize them in their personal drives. Personal drive organization is a nice feature because it allows each person to organize their work the way that makes the most sense to them, but sometimes it is more advantageous to have a folder in everybody’s drive which contains pads that are shared between all of them.</p>\n<p>Shared folders are complicated to implement. Unlike your personal drive which is just one realtime object (essentially it’s a pad), each shared folder must be a separate realtime object. Also, like a user account, a shared folder must be able to own pads, otherwise pads in that folder which are not in anyone’s personal drive risk being deleted by the server as per our expiration policy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You will be able to create a shared drive, just like you create a pad</li>\n<li>In your drive, you will be able to explore inside of the shared drive and organize it just like a folder</li>\n<li>You will be able to share the link to the Shared Drive with other people, when they click the link, it will import the shared drive into their personal drive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Shared Drive to take about <strong>20 days of development, a cost of €5,000</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-5-Federated-Messaging\"><a href=\"#Goal-5-Federated-Messaging\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 5 - Federated Messaging\"></a>Goal 5 - Federated Messaging</h1><p>There are about 150 CryptPad instances in existence, operated by people and organizations who want the privacy which CryptPad offers and also the additional security guarantee, decentralization and customization of their own instance. We want to support this usage while still allowing people on one instance to chat and message people on another instance. We want to support the ability to add contacts (Goal 3) with people registered on a different instance. You will then be able to at-reference them in a comment or share a pad with them using the share menu as you would with a person using the same instance as you.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you are on a pad or shared folder on somebody else’s instance, you will be able to import it to your instance</li>\n<li>Clicking a link to become a contact will work, even if you are registered on a different instance</li>\n<li>Once you have made a contact, all features in Contacts and Messaging will function across instances</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Federated Messaging to take about <strong>30 days of development, a cost of €7,500</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-6-Better-permissions\"><a href=\"#Goal-6-Better-permissions\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 6 - Better permissions\"></a>Goal 6 - Better permissions</h1><p>Initially, all pads were “open” pads, meaning they were accessible to anyone and there was no owner. Open pads are deleted automatically when they have not been touched in 3 months, unless a registered user has a reference to them. Once we added the ability to have registered users, we needed to make sure that users would not have the pads in their drive disappear off the server, so we implemented what we call pinning. Pinning is a way of claiming that a pad is important to you and that it should not be deleted. However, this left a problem, still pads had no owner, meaning nobody had the right to delete them. Once a pad was created, there was no way to delete it which was a serious problem for pads contining confidential information.</p>\n<p>In order to allow pads to be deleted, we implemented <em>owned pads</em>, and the splash screen registered users now see when they create a new pad. So now you can delete it from the server when you are done with it. However, two problems remain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The owner of a pad is the person who created it and there is no way to add owners or share ownership</li>\n<li>There is no way to revoke access once it has been given</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In order to solve #1, we will add the ability to share ownership with other people. For solving #2 in a Zero-Knowledge compatible way, we will need to introduce the concept of redirects, links which re-direct to the actual ID and key of the pad. Revoking access will be a matter of changing the pad’s ID and then updating all of the redirects which are <em>not</em> to be revoked. This will allow the creation of pads which can only be viewed by registered users who are invited. Even view-only links to a pad will be able to be revoked by the owners of that pad.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pads which are only accessible by people invited, or members of a group</li>\n<li>Grant and revoke access</li>\n<li>Create new links to a pad, and revoke them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect better permissions will take about <strong>40 days of development, a cost of €10,000</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-7-Color-by-author\"><a href=\"#Goal-7-Color-by-author\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 7 - Color-by-author\"></a>Goal 7 - Color-by-author</h1><p>After something is typed into a pad, the person who typed cannot be determined, we would like to change this and allow the etherpad-like behavior of shading the text differently based on who typed it. This will require getting the author from each patch in the stream of changes to the pad and making it available to the pad structure. In CryptPad there is a special message type which is called a checkpoint, it replaces the entire pad so that when a new person arrives in the pad, they don’t need to download more history than the previous 2 checkpoints. We will need to take special care to preserve the editor of each piece of the document when we create checkpoints, finally we will need to be able to shade the text based on it’s author, without either messing up CKEditor or causing the shading to be sent over the wire as if it were part of the pad.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When an option is selected, text in the rich text app will be shaded with a color based on the author of that text</li>\n<li>The user list will show users who have joined and then left again, along with the color of their changes</li>\n<li>Right-clicking on the text will show the name of the person who wrote it (including whether they are one of your contacts)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Color-by-author to take about <strong>20 days of development, a cost of €5,000</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-8-Offline-and-Suggested-Edits\"><a href=\"#Goal-8-Offline-and-Suggested-Edits\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 8 - Offline and Suggested Edits\"></a>Goal 8 - Offline and Suggested Edits</h1><p>Like color-by-author, Offline and Suggested Edits is a reasonably complicated feature to implement. When working on a complex document, it is nice to be able to propose a change without actually changing the document, or make a change while disconnected from the internet and then have someone (maybe you) merge it later. However, this is complicated because when it comes time to merge that change, the document may have significantly changed, necessitating a smart merge.</p>\n<p>Rich text pads in CryptPad are stored in a quazi-html representation so patching and merging is anything but simple. The operational transformation done normally on pads takes advantage of the fact that divergences are small and infrequent so merging usually works ok. This feature will require development of a smart merging algorithm for the rich text app as well as for any other app for which one would like to have suggested edits and offline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suggestion mode, your change is shown shaded and can be accepted or rejected, it will be attached to a comment so you can explain it</li>\n<li>When offline, you are automatically put into suggestion mode instead of read-only mode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect Offline and Suggested Edits to take <strong>40 days of development, a cost of €10,000</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"Goal-9-All-the-little-things\"><a href=\"#Goal-9-All-the-little-things\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Goal 9 - All the little things\"></a>Goal 9 - All the little things</h1><p>Even though it doesn’t get a lot of press, a significant amount of time is spent just fixing bugs, handling pull requests and doing releases. We want to keep CryptPad a community project and so we want to make sure that when someone makes a pull-request to the project, that request can be properly handled. Also, because CryptPad makes such use of modern HTML5 features, new releases of Chrome and Firefox typically introduce new bugs in CryptPad. There is rarely enough time to handle all of the issues which crop up, but we need to allocate time to handle some of them. This roadmap allocates the time of one person for 48 weeks, which means 24 releases, we need at least 1 day per release just to perform the release and write the release notes and fix miscellanious issues which appear.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep on fixing bugs in CryptPad </li>\n<li>Handle pull requests and make releases</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We expect all the little things to take <strong>30 days of development, a cost of €7,500</strong></p>\n"},{"title":"CryptPad #ZeroKnowledge Free Software needs funding","date":"2018-07-06T09:07:18.000Z","author":"Caleb James DeLisle","_content":"\n[Version française ? 🇫🇷](http://blog.ludovic.org/xwiki/bin/view/Blog/Aidez%20le%20projet%20libre%20CryptPad)\n\nOn October 31, 2014 the CryptPad project was first published, back then it was nothing more than a simple rich text pad and a horribly ugly front page.

They are all layered on top of the same CryptPad base infrastructure, but still it is not possible to create a new one without changing a few things in the CryptPad core. We would like to change this so that a new app can be added without changing anything else.</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptographically enforced Access Controls</strong>: Initially CryptPad had a very simple access control system, you share the link and that shares the pad. We added the ability to <em>publish</em> pads via read-only links and to assign a password to a pad, but we still don’t have the ability to share a pad with a group of people, or importantly, revoke access once it has been given. Traditional access controls are simple because the server is trusted to give and revoke access, however with CryptPad the server doesn’t have access to begin with so it must be done cryptographically. In the context of federation, cryptographic access controls are even more important since servers in the network can be run by anybody.</li>\n<li><strong>Federation and Messaging</strong>: The weakness in CryptPad security has always been securely sharing the pad link. Today there are about 150 CryptPad instances installed around the world, and we would like to allow people on different instances to share pads and send eachother messages. Furthermore, since we already have client-side encryption, we could easily extend messaging to support PGP for sharing of pad links and messages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fundamentally, our goal is as it always has been, to promote Zero Knowledge and an alternative to the Google Docs / Office365 hegemony on cloud office technology. However, this is not something we can do alone, we will need your help to move it forward.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-you-can-help\"><a href=\"#How-you-can-help\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How you can help\"></a>How you can help</h2><p>You can help CryptPad in a number of ways, if you’re a programmer then you can contribute code, if you’re a philanthropist and believe in these ideas then you can finance the roadmap or finance just particular features. What everyone can do is use CryptPad and spread the word and show people that it is possible to collaboratively edit documents without giving all the data to the server admins.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Contribute code</strong>: If you are a programmer and you are using CryptPad, help make it better, talk to us about what you would like to do with CryptPad and we will do our best to find a way that your code can be integrated.</li>\n<li><strong>Take a subscription</strong>: Every subscription helps bring a little more money into the project and this will be re-invested to make the CryptPad project better.

Dubost","_content":"\n![](/images/cryptpad-funding-blog-cover-generic.png)\n\nI've now let a few months pass since the last August status. I'm sorry about that as I have been very busy with XWiki SAS activities as well as conferences including CryptPad talks.\n\nI use this occasion to post the links to the different talks we had to present CryptPad and our goals:\n\n- [Toulouse Capitole du Libre (French)](https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/HUJaxog3vrIJpJJ37-kDAecBJN7Y8yblLtjQEYrUSWU/embed/present/)\n- [Paris Open Source Summit in the Privacy Track (French)](https://cryptpad.fr/slide/#/2/slide/view/d9tE0ekARv6YYcDroYIrLQelPpwnUbYNMQnLYHJXpDk/embed/present/)\n- Paris Open Source Summit in the Solutions Track (English by Aaron)\n\nWe have also been busy preparing some other funding opportunities for CryptPad which we believe can help bring more development to the project. Rest assured we are hard at work to make it happen. By the way, if you are an independent developer in Europe and you would like to be funded to work on a CryptPad project, contact us, we could have an opportunity for you.\n\nAlso I wanted to announce that in addition to the NGI Award \"Privacy and Trust Enhanding Technologies\" received last month for CryptPad, XWiki SAS has now also received an award at the Paris Open Source Summit from the CNLL (Conseil National du Logiciel Libre). This award \"Enterprise Award for an Open and Ethical Digital\" (Prix de l'Entreprise pour un numérique ouvert et éthique), recognizes XWiki SAS' involvement in sustainable free software development for the last 15 years. This of course includes our involvement in CryptPad and working hard to bring this free software solution to life and sustain its development. We are very proud of it and are committed to honor this award in the future.\n\nAgain we are grateful for our donators and subscribers as well as to all that relay our communications about the CryptPad crowdfunding campaign.\n\nIn the last three months we have received 1000 Euros from subscriptions and donations. this number has been growing in particular since we have launched yearly payments for subscriptions. \n\nWe have now exceeded 4000 Euros in funding for CryptPad since the beginning, including 1000 Euros of donations. This funding comes from 65 different sources from 19 different countries. 26 donators are coming through Open Collective.\n\n![cryptpad funding details](/images/cryptpad-201811-revenues-details.png)\n![cryptpad funding by type](/images/cryptpad-201811-countries.png)\n![cryptpad funding by country](/images/cryptpad-201811-revenuesources.png)\n\nWhile this cannot yet fund our two developers we are happy that the funding is progressing. We hope to continue to grow subscriptions and donators and have between 6k and 10k Euros by the end of the OpenPAAS NG project which currently funds us. Progressively we are getting close to secure funding for the project.\n\nNow we need more help ! First we need to be able to sustain our team, but also we need to be able to expand, especially if we want to have Open Source software in the Zero-Knowledge space. Proprietary closed source software providing some form of Zero-Knowledge will probably start growing with extensive funding. If we want independent free-software alternatives for this type of software, then we need to group our effort and fund open source solutions like CryptPad. We have ambitious objectives for CryptPad and we cannot achieve these with only two developers.\n\nSince the launch of the campaign we have also published a [roadmap for CryptPad](/tags/roadmap/) of what we would like to achieve with the funding. It's also available on the [OpenCollective web site](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad/#about). Come check it out and see our ambitious objectives for this project. We are already making progress on this roadmap.\n\nAaron and Yann, our CryptPad developers, have released the shared folders feature, one of the most demanded feature. We have also worked on improving the reliability of the synchronization engine (chainpad).\n\nTo finish, I'd like to give progress on CryptPad's usage. We are now reaching close to 200 instances of CryptPad running around the world, and the official cryptpad.fr instance is growing regularly. We have seen a surge in the last weeks, maybe related to the conferences, and we have now more than 1000 drive users, and 6000 pad visitors per week.

Today we released\n[CryptPad v1.7.0 (Hodag)](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.7.0). The biggest new feature in this version is that when you create a */code/* pad, the default highlighting is in markdown syntax and there it is rendered in realtime while you type. Try it out by making a pad at [cryptpad.fr/code](https://cryptpad.fr/code).\n\nIn this release we also completed something much more important and central to the future of CryptPad. We finished our first version of the payment server which allows you to take a subscription and help support the work that we do.\n\nStarting with this release we are now imposing a 50MB storage limit for our anonymous users and a 3 month expiration of pads which are not stored by a registered user. \n\nInstant collaboration is the vision of CryptPad and we are committed to continuing to provide that and even providing 50MB of persistent storage for anyone who is willing to sign up.\n\nFor people who are ready to take the next step, we are now providing subscriptions which will improve how you organize your information while helping CryptPad to grow and improve.\n\n## Plans\n\n1. Personal (5GB storage, 5€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* This is best for an individual using lots of pads for collaboration and note taking. For the price of a sandwich you can stay organized on all of your devices while also keeping your privacy private.\n2. Standard (20GB storage, 10€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* For the price of lunch, you can have 20GB of storage, enough for not only pads but also for the soon to launch File Upload which will allow Zero Knowledge storage of files such as pictures and PDF documents. With the Standard plan you can add one more friend for free.\n3. Team (50GB storage, 15€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* If you're ready to extend your usage of CryptPad to an entire team, we are ready to help you succeed. With a Team plan you get 50GB of data storage in CryptPad, plenty for files and pads. You also get to add **five** people to your plan and you get professional support available in English and French.\n\nOur goal is to make the best collaboration tool available while still being unable to sell or leak your content. Help us succeed, helping you stay organized and help show the world that Zero Knowledge Cloud is possible.\n\n## For Admins\n\nIf you're hosting your own instance of CryptPad, there are a few things you'll need to do when you upgrade to Hodag. The limits code is still somewhat of a mess and while we get it tied down, you'll need to do a bit of work to disable it.\n\nFirst there is a serverside per-user storage limit defined in `config.js` You'll want to set this to a big number like so:\n\n\tdefaultStorageLimit: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER\n    \nThen there is `customize/application_config.js`. If you're not familiar with `/customize/`, you can create this directory and then copy `application_config.js` over from the `/customize.dist/` directory so it will not be overwritten.

Today we released\n[CryptPad v1.7.0 (Hodag)](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.7.0). The biggest new feature in this version is that when you create a */code/* pad, the default highlighting is in markdown syntax and there it is rendered in realtime while you type. Try it out by making a pad at [cryptpad.fr/code](https://cryptpad.fr/code).\n\nIn this release we also completed something much more important and central to the future of CryptPad. We finished our first version of the payment server which allows you to take a subscription and help support the work that we do.\n\nStarting with this release we are now imposing a 50MB storage limit for our anonymous users and a 3 month expiration of pads which are not stored by a registered user. \n\nInstant collaboration is the vision of CryptPad and we are committed to continuing to provide that and even providing 50MB of persistent storage for anyone who is willing to sign up.\n\nFor people who are ready to take the next step, we are now providing subscriptions which will improve how you organize your information while helping CryptPad to grow and improve.\n\n## Plans\n\n1. Personal (5GB storage, 5€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* This is best for an individual using lots of pads for collaboration and note taking. For the price of a sandwich you can stay organized on all of your devices while also keeping your privacy private.\n2. Standard (20GB storage, 10€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* For the price of lunch, you can have 20GB of storage, enough for not only pads but also for the soon to launch File Upload which will allow Zero Knowledge storage of files such as pictures and PDF documents. With the Standard plan you can add one more friend for free.\n3. Team (50GB storage, 15€/month ex. VAT)\n\t* If you're ready to extend your usage of CryptPad to an entire team, we are ready to help you succeed. With a Team plan you get 50GB of data storage in CryptPad, plenty for files and pads. You also get to add **five** people to your plan and you get professional support available in English and French.\n\nOur goal is to make the best collaboration tool available while still being unable to sell or leak your content. Help us succeed, helping you stay organized and help show the world that Zero Knowledge Cloud is possible.\n\n## For Admins\n\nIf you're hosting your own instance of CryptPad, there are a few things you'll need to do when you upgrade to Hodag. The limits code is still somewhat of a mess and while we get it tied down, you'll need to do a bit of work to disable it.\n\nFirst there is a serverside per-user storage limit defined in `config.js` You'll want to set this to a big number like so:\n\n\tdefaultStorageLimit: Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER\n    \nThen there is `customize/application_config.js`. If you're not familiar with `/customize/`, you can create this directory and then copy `application_config.js` over from the `/customize.dist/` directory so it will not be overwritten.

Recently edited pads were remembered in the browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) which was not portable between computers but allowed some recent history to be kept.\n\nHowever, we wanted to allow people to login and manage their pads on all of their devices so we created the CryptDrive. Anyone who has used CryptPad but never logged in is encouraged to [register and login](https://cryptpad.fr/register) (it's free) and check out their drive. CryptDrive is basically just a realtime pad containing a JSON structure with links to all of your pads as well as their titles and other information. When you update the title of a pad, it changes the pad itself but it also changes your drive so that you can see the title of the pad in your drive. This is of course not perfect because if someone else changes the title of a pad, your drive will not be updated until you look at the pad again, but doing everything with the server completely blind to the content isn't easy, and this works reasonably well.\n\nHowever, CryptDrive causes an additional delay when loading CryptPad because whenever you load a document, you are actually loading two realtime instances. Since the drive is loaded over and over for every pad you view, it was obvious to us that we could make it more efficient using communication inside the browser.\n\n## First idea: Messages between tabs\n\nTabs (or windows) in a browser which are on the same website are able to [communicate using localStorage](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Using-Local-Storage-as-a-communication-channel) and so it seemed like a good solution to just have one tab claim the role of managing the drive and then when another tab is opened, it would message the first. However, this seemingly easy solution becomes a nightmare when you consider what happens when that tab is closed. The drive that everyone is relying on goes away and all of the other tabs are without a drive so they need to [flip a coin](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html) to decide which tab should become the keeper of the drive, then that tab needs to download the drive before it can service events, all the while any of the buttons which affect the drive (for instance deleting the pad) cannot possibly function. This idea was soon scrapped...\n\n## Enter ServiceWorker\nRecently, the HTML5 working group created a new standard called [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker) which for someone making a webapp seems like a dream come true. ServiceWorkers:\n\n* Are side-processes which are created one-per-website and live in the background.\n* Can intercept HTTP requests from your main javascript (excellent for caching!).\n* Is suspended when the last tab is closed, and re-launched when the user returns.\n* Are stored in suspended state even when the browser is turned off.\n* Supported by [every modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#search=serviceworker).\n\nWhen the website loads a worker, if the worker is already running it will not load and will instead defer to the existing worker. Communicating between workers and tabs which are on the website is possible via a [postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage) API and then the ServiceWorker can postMessage() which will reach all tabs that are navigated to the website.\n\nOne limitation of this design is versioning. Because the ServiceWorker would stay alive potentially forever, we needed to identify a way to upgrade it if a new version of CryptPad is released. This is quite important for CryptPad as version mismatches can lead to catastrophic conflicts between different browsers working on the same document.\n\nThough updating is non-trivial, we were able to solve it by sending version messages between different components of CryptPad and informing them whether they need to update (or even if they can *optionally* update). Since this seemed like a solvable problem, we tried creating an experimental implementatiton of ServiceWorkers in CryptPad, and then the fun started...\n\n### ServiceWorkers in Firefox\nSince Firefox 48, Firefox has begun following Chrome's model and running [different processes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox) for rendering the different tabs in the browser. However, this isolation has a side-effect that when you attempt to launch a ServiceWorker, it [may launch even though one already exists for the same website](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438945), because the other one exists in a different tab which happens to be operating in a different process. However, the postMessage() requests from tabs go out to all of the ServiceWorkers so this bug can be worked around.\n\nUnfortunately we encountered some more issues with Firefox which we found not worth debugging. Our CryptDrive is a Javascript object which is represented in the encrypted realtime document as JSON and there is an ES6 [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object in order to allow every change to the drive to be propagated to the underlying realtime object. In Firefox the proxy did not work when used in a ServiceWorker and at times our ServiceWorker simply stopped running.\n\n### Reporting bugs in browsers\nOne might think these are great opportunities to report issues with Firefox, and when we find an [issue which we think will affect lots of people](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434278) especially if it is a regression, we don't hesitate to report it, but usually it is not clear how to reproduce the issue, whether there might be some error in our usage of the API which is being smoothed over by Chrome, or whether the component being reported on is a priority, in that case rather rain low quality bug reports down upon the poor browser developers, we spend our limited time trying to make CryptPad better. In the case of ServiceWorker in Firefox, our conclusion is that in effect the technology remains experimental and shouldn't be relied upon.\n\n## SharedWorker to the rescue\nFortunately there is another technology called [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) which is essentially identical to a plain vanilla WebWorker but can communicate with all tabs which are navigated to the site. Unfortunately this technology is only supported in [Chrome and Firefox](https://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedworkers), but the support for this technology, we found, really works!\n\nHowever, Firefox still has the [issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438945) with of multiple SharedWorkers being created for multiple tabs, but since this issue is fixable we were able to go ahead with it anyway. For browsers which have no SharedWorker, they would fallback to plain old WebWorker. Though this seems like it would be a problem, it is in fact quite fine because actions done in the drive by another WebWorker are the same as actions done in the drive by another device, they need to be encrypted and sent to the server in order to persist anyway.\n\n## Faster CryptPad\nComing in the release on Tuesday June 26, 2018, we will have a new SharedWorker based CryptPad instance, that means when you use Chrome or Firefox, the first time you open CryptPad, it will load your drive, but then every tab you open after that will communicate with the SharedWorker managing the drive and therefore pads will load nearly twice as fast.\n","source":"_posts/Faster-loads-with-SharedWorker-ServiceWorker.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Faster loads with SharedWorker & ServiceWorker\ndate: 2018-06-22 21:21:58\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - web worker\n  - shared worker\n  - performance\n---\n\nWhen CryptPad was first created, the only thing to load was the CryptPad code itself and the pad which you were editing.

Recently edited pads were remembered in the browser’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">localStorage</a> which was not portable between computers but allowed some recent history to be kept.</p>\n<p>However, we wanted to allow people to login and manage their pads on all of their devices so we created the CryptDrive. Anyone who has used CryptPad but never logged in is encouraged to <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/register\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">register and login</a> (it’s free) and check out their drive. CryptDrive is basically just a realtime pad containing a JSON structure with links to all of your pads as well as their titles and other information. When you update the title of a pad, it changes the pad itself but it also changes your drive so that you can see the title of the pad in your drive. This is of course not perfect because if someone else changes the title of a pad, your drive will not be updated until you look at the pad again, but doing everything with the server completely blind to the content isn’t easy, and this works reasonably well.</p>\n<p>However, CryptDrive causes an additional delay when loading CryptPad because whenever you load a document, you are actually loading two realtime instances. Since the drive is loaded over and over for every pad you view, it was obvious to us that we could make it more efficient using communication inside the browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-idea-Messages-between-tabs\"><a href=\"#First-idea-Messages-between-tabs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First idea: Messages between tabs\"></a>First idea: Messages between tabs</h2><p>Tabs (or windows) in a browser which are on the same website are able to <a href=\"http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Using-Local-Storage-as-a-communication-channel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">communicate using localStorage</a> and so it seemed like a good solution to just have one tab claim the role of managing the drive and then when another tab is opened, it would message the first.

CryptPad","date":"2017-04-20T06:45:09.000Z","author":"Aaron MacSween","_content":"\nCryptPad started as a novel idea:\n\n> provide a means for people to collaborate on the web, without their data being exposed to the server that connects them\n\nSince its conception as one developer's hobby project, this idea has grown organically into a team of core developers, a community of contributors, and a growing number of people who collaborate with CryptPad every day.\n\n## How we're able to do this work\n\nCryptPad is a part of the OpenPaaS-NG project, which is funded by [BPIFrance](http://www.bpifrance.fr/).\nAs mentioned in [our April 1st post](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/04/01/Exciting-news/), this funding only applies to 50% of our expenses.\nI joked that the other 50% was being covered by our new partners (the _**NSA**_), but in fact, the remainder is still covered entirely by [XWiki SAS](http://xwiki.com).\n\nWe have a fair amount of autonomy when it comes to deciding what features we will develop.\nWith that in mind, however, there are some long term goals that come as a part of OpenPaaS, some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.\n\nWe recognize that however people's goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.\n\nBy operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we're able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.\nOur ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.\n\nSince the [OpenPaaS-NG project](https://open-paas.org/) is only funded until 2019, we've been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.\n\n## Our new funding strategies\n\nMany of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.\n\nWe've chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we're doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe're willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are _willing to pay not to be a product themselves_.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.\n\n### Paid hosting\n\n[CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.\nSo far, this hasn't been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won't be something that we can sustain.\n\nIn many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.\nIn other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.\n\nTo address this problem, we've implemented **pinning**, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, _those which aren't pinned by a registered user_, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.\nWe believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.\n\n* Pinning will only be available to registered users.\n* Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017\n* Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.\n  * new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive\n  * removing a file from your drive's trash will unpin it\n* Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed\n  * effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)\n* Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.\n* For additional storage, you'll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.\n* We'll have more information about pricing soon.\n\n### Support contracts for private installations\n\nIf you've decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.\nLike you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.\n\nIf you're using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.\nWe're still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki's many customers in the past.\nYou can see an example of XWiki's pricing [here](http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise).\n\nIf you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.\nOtherwise, if you find that you're comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you'd like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we'll be there to help.\n\n### Sponsored development of open source features\n\nIf there's a particular feature you'd like to see implemented within CryptPad, we're able to dedicate development time to build it into the software in the best way possible.\n\nSponsored development allows us to build features to suit particular users' needs.\nBy integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.\nThis helps us refine those features to be even more useful for you, and ensures that they will continue to be supported well into the future.\n\n## What's next\n\nSince we announced our [bi-weekly release schedule](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/), we've tried to make sure that each release contains an exciting feature.\nThis time around, we've had to set some time aside to implement pinning, as well as code for reporting the size used by any one user's drive.\nWe realize this isn't especially interesting for most of you, but it will be necessary for some more advanced features which we hope to share with you soon.\n\nBy providing a quota system for our registered users, we will be able to offer encrypted file upload capabilities.\nYou'll be able to upload images, and embed them in presentations and pads, a process which has been somewhat difficult so far.\nOur decision to limit users' upload capacity is intended less to make a profit, and more to limit abuse.\n\nWe recognize that disk space is getting cheaper all the time, and that cloud hosting services will be able to offer more competitive pricing.\nOur aim isn't to compete with the giants in the cloud industry, but simply to finance our ongoing research into privacy-friendly collaboration.\nThere is still much to do, but working together, we can accomplish great things.\n\n","source":"_posts/Funding-CryptPad.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Funding CryptPad\ndate: 2017-04-20 12:15:09\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  - research\n  - funding\n---\n\nCryptPad started as

some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.</p>\n<p>We recognize that however people’s goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.</p>\n<p>By operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we’re able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.\nOur ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.</p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://open-paas.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OpenPaaS-NG project</a> is only funded until 2019, we’ve been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Our-new-funding-strategies\"><a href=\"#Our-new-funding-strategies\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Our new funding strategies\"></a>Our new funding strategies</h2><p>Many of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.</p>\n<p>We’ve chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we’re doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe’re willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are <em>willing to pay not to be a product themselves</em>.</p>\n<p>To be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing

other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, we’ve implemented <strong>pinning</strong>, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, <em>those which aren’t pinned by a

deal of our funding status for the last while, and for good reason.\nCryptPad has largely been funded by the [OpenPaaS](https://open-paas.org/) research and development project, funded by [BPIFrance](http://www.bpifrance.com/).\nWe're very happy with the results of the past four years of work, but this support will terminate at the end of March 2019.\n\nWhile this change is a bit scary for us, it also means that we'll be free to pursue new research projects.\nEurope is investing in technologies that promote human-centric values, so there are many opportunities that align with our goals.\nWe have been actively seeking funding from a variety of sources, and though things are currently uncertain for us, it's quite likely that **our team will need to expand** to prepare for upcoming obligations.\n\n## The skills we want\n\nWe're looking for _web technologists_ and _product designers_ with experience in [privacy engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_engineering).\nIf you already use CryptPad, encrypted messengers, or other similar communication systems to protect your personal data, that knowledge will be an asset.\nIf you use unencrypted platforms and have a good understanding of the personal and societal trade-offs, that will count in your favour as well.\n\nThis field is fairly young, so we're open to any experience you have, not just what you've learned in a professional or academic context.\n\nIn terms of technical skills, our daily work typically includes:\n\n* Clientside Javascript (ES5) and cross-platform browser APIs\n* Nodejs\n* CSS3 and LESS\n* HTML5\n* BASH\n* GIT\n* SSH, information security, and basic system administration\n\nWe're interested in incorporating skills we don't already have, so don't panic if you're unfamiliar with anything listed above.\n\nPerhaps more important than the technical skills are the so-called _soft skills_:\n\n* Empathizing with users and prioritizing improvements based on their impact\n* Communicating well within a team (including asking for clarification if your goals are ever unclear)\n* Managing your time well (we avoid micro-managing and working overtime)\n* Reasoning about pragmatic security\n* Consideration of both immediate tasks and long-term goals\n\n## What we offer\n\nXWiki SAS has been developing open-source software for the last 15 years, and we rely on the open-source tooling internally.\nJoining our team means learning how to run a sustainable business while giving away our product for free (without selling user data).\n\nOtherwise you can expect:\n\n* A relaxed work environment (in _Paris, France_ or _Iasi, Romania_) with part-time remote work\n  * or negotiable full-time if relocation is not possible or desireable\n* To develop portable skills using open-source software\n* International travel (at our expense) when promoting the company or our projects\n* Opportunities for advancement, training, and other benefits\n* The chance to shape the future of an exciting project with your personal view of responsible data handling\n* To become an expert in privacy-enhancing technologies

started working full-time on CryptPad.\nAt that point fewer than 10 people used the service on a weekly basis.\nOur development team was included in that list, often multiple times since we visited from both our office and our homes.\n\nIn those early days the platform was much more of a toy than a tool.\nThere was no _CryptDrive_ for storing documents, no login, markdown rendering, file upload, kanban, or whiteboard.\nIt was the first of four years of a research project in which we were responsible for building a variety of collaborative editors.\nWe mostly used CryptPad to prototype new technologies before committing to a much more complex integration into the larger project.\nNobody insisted that our editors include the extra privacy features we designed, yet, among our small team we definitely hoped they would catch on.\n\nWe knew that as long as we produced viable editors and passed our project's yearly reviews we didn't have to worry about our jobs.\nIt felt like we were supposed to take risks and we certainly did.\nThe stakes were low.\nSometimes if we wanted to test the platform together we'd just push our code to our production server.\nOccasionally we'd edit files directly on the server to cut out additional steps.\nWe did our work as quickly as we could without having to worry about the consequences because nobody was relying on us for their safety.\n\nIt was an exciting time.\n\n## Two thousand and nineteen\n\nOur situation today is drastically different.\nPrivacy is very much in the public eye, although the news is more often bad than good.\nIn any case, instead of ten weekly visitors [CryptPad.fr](https:/cryptpad.fr) now supports more than ten thousand.\n\nMany of those that trust us to protect their information have no cause to use our service other than the very reasonable expectation that nobody will access their content without their consent.\nWe're pleased to be able to offer this peace of mind and we appreciate that we need this demographic and its expectations to become the norm if those with more extreme requirements are to blend in with the crowd.\nAs the saying goes: _privacy is a team sport_.\n\nAs proud as I am of the project's advancement since our humble beginnings, I still feel as though we've been playing this sport defensively in these last 365 days.\nWe began the year with the knowledge that our stable funding was about to dry up and that our efforts to sustain the project via subscriptions and donations were not going to be enough.\nAt the same time, increasingly more of our time was occupied just keeping up with regular issues: answering emails, fixing bugs, and managing a progressively more complex codebase.\nMeanwhile, we had to consider the effects of every change on those users whose physical safety occasionally depends on their privacy.\n\nFortunately for us and our community we received an enormous amount of support from Europe's [Next Generation Internet initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/), both in terms of publicity through the presentation of [an NGI award](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/02/22/Heading-to-Barcelona/) and monetary contributions through the [NLnet PET](https://nlnet.nl/PET/) grant program.\nWe've still had to cope with an endless stream of feature requests and correspondences, but the funding definitely addressed our existential worries for a time.\n\nIn the course of our [CryptPad Teams](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/05/27/Our-future-is-collaborative/) project we struggled to balance all the responsibilities of our position and as a result it's taken somewhat longer to complete the project than we planned.\nI now have a better appreciation of how much easier a project can appear in its planning compared to its execution.\nThe opportunity to go slightly over budget on a small project has been a welcome learning experience that I hope not to repeat.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAt this stage in our project it isn't enough for our team to try to keep up with tickets on our issue tracker.\nReactionary decisions won't make our project sustainable, nor will they effectively serve the community that has helped us get this far.\nThat's why in 2020 we're going to focus on project governance and providing a cohesive vision with the hope of getting more of our stakeholders directly involved in its success.\n\nI spent a large part of this holiday season making small changes to make it easier to correctly configure a CryptPad instance.\nStarting in January we're going to continue this effort to support the 300 independent instance administrators with a radical overhaul of our documentation, along with simplified guides for users and more detailed guides for contributors.\n\nOur immediate roadmap will also feature further development of our admin panel to ensure that community instances can be governed by team members lacking advanced technological expertise.\nBeyond that we're looking forward to some big improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely our rich text, spreadsheet, and kanban apps.\n\nThere's still a lot of work we can do to improve the social integrations first proposed in our _Teams_ project.\nWe'll continue to streamline the process of onboarding new team members and add in some even more advanced controls for very sensitive data.\n\nI've been hesitant to commit to development time that doesn't yet have a source of funding but in the coming year I hope to be able to deliver an improved experience for users of mobile and touch-enabled devices.\n\n## How you can help\n\nPrivacy should not be a luxury item.\nCryptPad has been built largely with public money and we're committed to continuing its development as a public good.\nContinued monetary contributions via donations enable us to offer our services to users regardless of whether they can contribute themselves.\n\nAlong with subscriptions to our platform, our independent revenue helps to finance all the minor tasks that don't easily fit into the narrative of a successful grant proposal.\nEvery cent of these revenue streams go back into development and we do our best to get the most value out of your contributions.\n\nThere are, of course, many other ways you can contribute.\nAny publicity you can generate will free us to spend less time marketing and more time improving the software and its documentation.\nSharing our messages on social media with your followers helps a lot, so please follow us on the [Fediverse](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptpad).\nWe especially appreciate personal messages that tell the world exactly what it is you love about CryptPad.\n\nWe're also happy to support and publicize offline events promoting the project.\nIf you're comfortable speaking in public and would like to represent us in your community feel free to contact us about and we'll see how we can help.\n\nAs we produce [more documentation](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad-guide/) we'll also need help reviewing it and keeping it up to date.\nEvery little bit helps, whether it's a page or a line of documentation corrected.\nFinally, we welcome any efforts to translate CryptPad into a new language or to help those already working on our [existing translations](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/).\n\n## Wishes for 2020\n\nI made a deliberate choice in naming the most recent cycle of releases after extinct animals.\nWe are living through a major extinction event and growing list of crises.\nMore than ever we need a hopeful vision of the future.\n\nI'm personally grateful for the opportunity to offer tools to support these endeavors.\n\nEmbrace private spaces.  \nConnect with those around you.  \nOrganize and build a better future together.\n\nSee you in 2020!\n\n","source":"_posts/Looking-back-looking-forward.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Looking back, looking forward'\ndate: 2019-12-31 16:06:16\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  - roadmap\n---\n\nIt was

planning compared to its execution.\nThe opportunity to go slightly over budget on a small project has been a welcome learning experience that I hope not to repeat.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nAt this stage in our project it isn't enough for our team to try to keep up with tickets on our issue tracker.\nReactionary decisions won't make our project sustainable, nor will they effectively serve the community that has helped us get this far.\nThat's why in 2020 we're going to focus on project governance and providing a cohesive vision with the hope of getting more of our stakeholders directly involved in its success.\n\nI spent a large part of this holiday season making small changes to make it easier to correctly configure a CryptPad instance.\nStarting in January we're going to continue this effort to support the 300 independent instance administrators with a radical overhaul of our documentation, along with simplified guides for users and more detailed guides for contributors.\n\nOur immediate roadmap will also feature further development of our admin panel to ensure that community instances can be governed by team members lacking advanced technological expertise.\nBeyond that we're looking forward to some big improvements to the tools that are most essential to effectively coordinate distributed groups of people, namely our rich text, spreadsheet, and kanban apps.\n\nThere's still a lot of work we can do to improve the social integrations first proposed in our _Teams_ project.\nWe'll continue to streamline the process of onboarding new team members and add in some even more advanced controls for very sensitive data.\n\nI've been hesitant to commit to development time that doesn't yet have a source of funding but in the coming year I hope to be able to deliver an improved experience for users of mobile and touch-enabled devices.\n\n## How you can help\n\nPrivacy should not be a luxury item.\nCryptPad has been built largely with public money and we're committed to continuing its development as a public good.\nContinued monetary contributions via donations enable us to offer our services to users regardless of whether they can contribute themselves.\n\nAlong with subscriptions to our platform, our independent revenue helps to finance all the minor tasks that don't easily fit into the narrative of a successful grant proposal.\nEvery cent of these revenue streams go back into development and we do our best to get the most value out of your contributions.\n\nThere are, of course, many other ways you can contribute.\nAny publicity you can generate will free us to spend less time marketing and more time improving the software and its documentation.\nSharing our messages on social media with your followers helps a lot, so please follow us on the [Fediverse](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptpad).\nWe especially appreciate personal messages that tell the world exactly what it is you love about CryptPad.\n\nWe're also happy to support and publicize offline events promoting the project.\nIf you're comfortable speaking in public and would like to represent us in your community feel free to contact us about and we'll see how we can help.\n\nAs we produce [more documentation](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad-guide/) we'll also need help reviewing it and keeping it up to date.\nEvery little bit helps, whether it's a page or a line of documentation corrected.\nFinally, we welcome any efforts to translate CryptPad into a new language or to help those already working on our [existing translations](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/).\n\n## Wishes for 2020\n\nI made a deliberate choice in naming the most recent cycle of releases after extinct animals.\nWe are living through a major extinction event and growing list of crises.\nMore than ever we need a hopeful vision of the future.\n\nI'm personally grateful for the opportunity to offer tools to support these endeavors.\n\nEmbrace private spaces.  \nConnect with those around you.  \nOrganize and build a better future together.\n\nSee you in

James DeLisle","_content":"\n<script src=\"https://cryptpad.fr/common/media-tag-nacl.min.js\"></script>\n\nIn CryptPad development, we have always tried to push the limits of the technology. As you might know, we don't minify any of our javascript code and we have no build system, yet CryptPad is still faster than many similar projects which do. In recent profiling, we determined that the biggest cause of slow loading was compilng of less stylesheets.\n\nAll of the styles for CryptPad are written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/) CSS templating language and because we don't have a build system, when you load a page on CryptPad, it downloads the less compiler and runs it in your browser. When the less has been compiled the first time, it is cached in the browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) so that it doesn't need to be compiled again (until next release). Unfortunately, the way we structured CryptPad Less code led to this taking a long time.\n\nCSS by its nature is very much like object inheritence, a design pattern popular in the 1990s which has [since](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-85233-856-3_23) [been](https://codeburst.io/inheritance-is-evil-stop-using-it-6c4f1caf5117) [discredited](http://neethack.com/2017/04/Why-inheritance-is-bad/). In a bid to keep our styles under control, we decided to make heavy use of Less [mixins](http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature). The idea was that we didn't want our CSS code to \"speak until it was spoken to\".\n\nSomething like the following would be very problematic if it were dumped on the global scope, but it is never output until it is called:\n\n```\n.example_header() {\n    a {\n        color: red;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\nSo then the code which uses it can invoke it only in the exact place where it ought to be used.\n\n```\n@include \"example.less\";\n.cp-app-pad {\n    .cp-padheader {\n        .cp-padheader-left {\n            .example_header();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're a CSS purist, you're probably pulling your hair out now, because *the right way* is to use html classes. The thing is, we do, but because CryptPad is made up of many different pieces of open source software, we cannot control all of the HTML and sometimes things [aren't so simple](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/2.4.0/customize.dist/src/less2/include/ckeditor-fix.less). Using mixins gave us an extra layer of safety and allowed us to write CSS feeling quite confident that it would not end up changing things where it wasn't supposed to.\n\n<img src=\"/images/Strip-CSS-respect-650-finalenglish1.jpg\">\n\n<center data-yeah-i-know-a-center-tag=\"so sue me\">*Cascading works great, until you include one CSS file that was written by this guy.*</center>\n\n## Parameterized mixins\n\nAn excellent feature of Less is parameterized mixins, that is, templates with arguments. One of our biggest templates is called `.toolbar_main()` and this builds the toolbar at the top of CryptPad as well as the user-list on the lefthand side. In order to make the customizable colors with the same HTML structure, we opted to use a parameterized mixin like this:\n\n```\n.toolbar_main (\n    @color: @colortheme_default-color, // Color of the text for the toolbar\n    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg, // color of the toolbar background\n    @warn-color: @colortheme_default-warn, // color of the warning text in the toolbar\n    @barWidth: 600px // width of the toolbar\n) {\n/// a lot of code here, using colors based on the parameters,\n/// but lightened or darkened using less functions.\n};\n```\n\nThen each app would call `.toolbar_main()` with its own color parameters, and get a nice toolbar, customized to that app's color theme. Again, this is not the only way to do it, but having the ability to generate CSS with highly specific color rules proved to be extremely useful for overriding leaked styles coming from the software that we integrate.\n\n## State explosion\n\nWhat we didn't think about at that time was the effect that the proliferation of CryptPad Apps would have on the amount of CSS being generated. We started with just a few styles and just a few apps to apply those styles on.\n\n<media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/ba/baf60fc13e35117c60337bbd93ee1dd43ede9280fe5aa583\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:9nEx58X4nrmTYmi5i8K8bb6DvTRemmYubZbU1J1dDa0=\"></media-tag>\n\nBut as we added more and more CryptPad apps, the same CSS was being generated and applied over and over...\n\n<media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/1b/1b5e6189a55efb7ea30ff1cc128597ce76b158fd659d6f45\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:tvxTuU3P5nqqQ75TMRsjehvOjljlkSGzpZTgrfhgGSg=\"></media-tag>\n\nThen as our styles become more complex, the CSS which was being copy/pasted by less compiler became bigger and bigger\n\n<media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/83/8398106a4ee0109630793846cabfdecaa8ee80313cca7e37\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:qy+1nKYU8sQiQR88IgqyxAfspxZiEN8Q3NkBI2qpPOA=\"></media-tag>\n\nThe total of all our less code in the entire project was only 235k, and it was compiling to over **1.3 megabytes of CSS**. We cache the compiled CSS by placing it in [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), but still, every time a new version of CryptPad was released, the CSS needed to be recompiled and this was dominating the loading time.\n\n## Building a Linker for CSS\n\nIf you have experience with C/C++, you might recognize this problem. It is as if there was no linker and the only way to reuse code was to use preprocessor `#include` over and over again.\n\nSince by this point, we had a significant amount of Less which was designed this way, rewriting it was not an option, so we started looking for ways to *link* it rather than copy/pasting it over and over again. Fortunately most of the bigger mixins only applied rules to specific classes, so moving them up to the root level would not cause trouble, though to be safe, we wanted to only load the styles that were necessary.\n\nIf we would indicate to the javascript code which loaded the Less that a particular Less file was needed, it could be compiled, cached and included *separately*, and thus it could be reused across apps. In order to keep the Less API as close to the same as possible, we decided to put that indication inside of the `.<filename>_main()` mixin.\n\nSo `.dropdown_main()` went from this:\n\n```\n.dropdown_main () {\n    // all the code here\n}\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n```\n.dropdown_main () {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n};\n& {\n    // all the code here\n}\n```\n\nTwo important things to note: firstly `LessLoader_currentFile()` is a function which we created (as the name implies, it's defined in `LessLoader.js`), it simply expands to the current function name. Secondly, when a less file is included with the `reference` flag (e.g. `@include (reference) \"./dropdown.less\";`) the content is not output but the mixins are made available, so moving the code down to the bottom of `dropdown.less` would cause it not to end up in the compilation of `app-pad.less`.\n\nThe resulting CSS from this contains something like this:\n\n```\n--LessLoader_require: \"/customize/src/less/include/dropdown.less\";\n```\n\nLessLoader would then simply scan for `--LessLoader_require:` and trigger loading of those files, which are still parsed by Less, but are the same for every CryptPad app.\n\n### Parameters with CSS variables\n\nIn this example, I intentionally left out the parameterized mixins. Solving this was slightly more complicated and in order to do it, we made use of a reasonably new feature in web browsers: [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables). \n\nToday, one can write in CSS the following:\n\n```\n:root {\n    --color-should-be: brown;\n}\n\n// potentially much later...\n.element {\n    color: var(--color-should-be);\n}\n```\n\nand the element text will be brown. Discovering this was a breakthrough because it meant that the arguments could be turned into variables in `app-pad.less` and then made use of in `toolbar.less`. However, there are limitations to what you can do with CSS variables. For example, this doesn't work:\n\n```\n:root {\n    --hack-boolean: 1;\n}\n\n// later on...\n\n@media screen and (max-width: calc(var(--hack-boolean) * 100000000)) {\n    // HAHAHA I MADE AN IF STATEMENT\n    :root { --lets-define-another-variable: \"lol\"; }\n}\n```\n<center>*If this worked, I'd probably be using it*</center>\n\n<br>\n\n#### Scoped CSS variables\n\nWhat does work, however, is specifying different values of the same variable at different scopes, so this does work:\n\n```\n.my-button { --button-color: red; }\n.my-popup-window .my-button { --button-color: blue; }\n\n// later on...\n\n.my-button {\n    background-color: var(--button-color);\n}\n```\n\nBut possible uses/abuses of this feature were not investigated.\n\n#### Making it work\n\nFollowing the general principle of [keeping the variable definition close to the usage](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/), we put the variable definitions inside of the `.<filename>_main()` mixin and the usages below in the same file. In order to avoid namespace collisons, we prefixed all variables with the name of the file. A simplified version of avatar.less looks like this:\n\n```\n.avatar_main(@width) {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n    --avatar-width: @width;\n}\n& {\n    &.cp-avatar {\n        ...\n        .cp-avatar-default, media-tag {\n            width: var(--avatar-width);\n```\n\nIn some cases, we needed to introduce additional variables because of the use of Less functions such as [lighten() and darken()](http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations), which obviously cannot work on CSS variables. So we used the following pattern in many places:\n\n```\n.help_main (@color, @bg-color) {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);\n    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;\n    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));\n\n    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;\n    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;\n    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;\n};\n```\n\n### Results\n\nAfter carefully planning and studying solutions, we managed a fairly non-invasive refactoring of the styles which took Less compile time down from almost 3 seconds to around 900ms. For simplistic pages like the front page, the number dropped to around 200ms.\n\nThe key result is that a person who has never seen CryptPad before will see the main page right away instead of waiting 3 or more seconds to compile all the less for the entire project.\n\n## But wait, what about Internet Explorer ?\n\nThis question is the bane of many web developers' existance. In this case, the problem is that [Internet Explorer has no CSS variables](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/csscustompropertiesakacssvariables/). Last week we changed CryptPad so that when you use it, your browser will let us know if it doesn't support CSS variables. This is done using the [feedback mechanism](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/07/07/cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know/#What-we-collect-because-we-want-to-know) which is an opt-out collection of information such as how often particular features are used and whether certain things are supported by the browsers of people using CryptPad.\n\nWhat we found is that in the past week, we saw about 50 unique users who are running browsers which don't support CSS variables. With our approximately 4500 unique users per week, this is a little over 1%.\n\n### Making an acceptable fallback\n\nThe One Percent jokes asside, it's hard to justify making CryptPad 300% slower for everyone who tries it for the first time, just to satisfy about 1% of the userbase. But at the same time, it's sad to drop support for a browser which at the current moment does work with CryptPad.\n\nThe solution we devised was to specify default values and then override them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n    .cp-markdown-toolbar {\n        ...\n        button {\n            // IE sees this (variable compiled by less)\n            color: @toolbar-color;\n            \n            // everyone else sees this\n            color: var(--toolbar-color);\n```\n\nThe only question remaining was how to specify the defaults in a way that was simple for us when we worked on the less files. Most of our `.<filemane>_main()` parameterized mixins already had default values in case they were called without parameters, so we already knew what sane defaults would be. What we decided to do was create a new mixin called `.<filename>_vars()`, which would assign a set of Less variables based on the arguments.\n\nThe final result looked like this:\n\n```\n.help_vars (\n    @color: @colortheme_default-color,\n    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg\n) {\n    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);\n    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;\n    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));\n}\n.help_main (@color, @bg-color) {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n    .help_vars(@color, @bg-color);\n    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;\n    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;\n    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;\n};\n& {\n    .help_vars();\n    .cp-help-container {\n\n        position: relative;\n        background-color: @help-bg-color-l15;\n        background-color: var(--help-bg-color-l15);\n```\n\nGoing through it step-by-step, the `.help_vars()` mixin takes parameters but it defines default values, then it creates some Less variables which are accessed after it is used. `.help_main()` calls `.help_vars()` and passes it arguments, then takes it's results and assigns them to CSS variables. Then the main block of the Less file also calls `.help_vars()` but without any arguments, so the defaults are used. Then in the main block, each usage of a CSS variable also has the usage of the less variable. The less variable provides the default value, the one which IE will see, and then the CSS variable provides the specified value, the one which will be different per CryptPad application.\n\n## There you have it\n\nEvery Less file now gets loaded twice, first it is loaded by the `@include (reference)` call, where it is parsed in order to expose the `.<filename>_main()` mixin, then it is loaded a second time as an independent file. Importantly, however, once it is compiled it is stored into localStorage and the toolbar CSS which is compiled when you go to the Rich Text app is the exact same CSS which will be used when you go to the Code/Markdown app. This feature is available in the `staging` branch of the CryptPad project and will be on CryptPad.fr in the next release.\n\nWe could make it even faster, by separating the main content of the Less files from the `.<filename>_vars()` and `.<filename>_main()` mixins, essentially making header files, in C/C++ parlance. And if we find in future profiling that less compiling remains a signficant performance penalty, there's a good chance that we will.\n","source":"_posts/Making-CryptPad-CSS-3-times-faster-by-loading-it-twice.md","raw":"---\ntitle: 'Making CryptPad CSS 3 times faster, by loading it twice'\ndate: 2018-07-20 12:00:59\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - performance\n  - css\n---\n\n<script src=\"https://cryptpad.fr/common/media-tag-nacl.min.js\"></script>\n\nIn CryptPad development, we have always tried to push the limits of the technology.

So we used the following pattern in many places:\n\n```\n.help_main (@color, @bg-color) {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);\n    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;\n    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));\n\n    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;\n    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;\n    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;\n};\n```\n\n### Results\n\nAfter carefully planning and studying solutions, we managed a fairly non-invasive refactoring of the styles which took Less compile time down from almost 3 seconds to around 900ms. For simplistic pages like the front page, the number dropped to around 200ms.\n\nThe key result is that a person who has never seen CryptPad before will see the main page right away instead of waiting 3 or more seconds to compile all the less for the entire project.\n\n## But wait, what about Internet Explorer ?\n\nThis question is the bane of many web developers' existance. In this case, the problem is that [Internet Explorer has no CSS variables](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/csscustompropertiesakacssvariables/). Last week we changed CryptPad so that when you use it, your browser will let us know if it doesn't support CSS variables. This is done using the [feedback mechanism](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/07/07/cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know/#What-we-collect-because-we-want-to-know) which is an opt-out collection of information such as how often particular features are used and whether certain things are supported by the browsers of people using CryptPad.\n\nWhat we found is that in the past week, we saw about 50 unique users who are running browsers which don't support CSS variables. With our approximately 4500 unique users per week, this is a little over 1%.\n\n### Making an acceptable fallback\n\nThe One Percent jokes asside, it's hard to justify making CryptPad 300% slower for everyone who tries it for the first time, just to satisfy about 1% of the userbase. But at the same time, it's sad to drop support for a browser which at the current moment does work with CryptPad.\n\nThe solution we devised was to specify default values and then override them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\n    .cp-markdown-toolbar {\n        ...\n        button {\n            // IE sees this (variable compiled by less)\n            color: @toolbar-color;\n            \n            // everyone else sees this\n            color: var(--toolbar-color);\n```\n\nThe only question remaining was how to specify the defaults in a way that was simple for us when we worked on the less files. Most of our `.<filemane>_main()` parameterized mixins already had default values in case they were called without parameters, so we already knew what sane defaults would be. What we decided to do was create a new mixin called `.<filename>_vars()`, which would assign a set of Less variables based on the arguments.\n\nThe final result looked like this:\n\n```\n.help_vars (\n    @color: @colortheme_default-color,\n    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg\n) {\n    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);\n    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;\n    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));\n}\n.help_main (@color, @bg-color) {\n    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();\n    .help_vars(@color, @bg-color);\n    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;\n    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;\n    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;\n};\n& {\n    .help_vars();\n    .cp-help-container {\n\n        position: relative;\n        background-color: @help-bg-color-l15;\n        background-color: var(--help-bg-color-l15);\n```\n\nGoing through it step-by-step, the `.help_vars()` mixin takes parameters but it defines default values, then it creates some Less variables which are accessed after it is used. `.help_main()` calls `.help_vars()` and passes it arguments, then takes it's results and assigns them to CSS variables. Then the main block of the Less file also calls `.help_vars()` but without any arguments, so the defaults are used. Then in the main block, each usage of a CSS variable also has the usage of the less variable. The less variable provides the default value, the one which IE will see, and then the CSS variable provides the specified value, the one which will be different per CryptPad application.\n\n## There you have it\n\nEvery Less file now gets loaded twice, first it is loaded by the `@include (reference)` call, where it is parsed in order to expose the `.<filename>_main()` mixin, then it is loaded a second time as an independent file. Importantly, however, once it is compiled it is stored into localStorage and the toolbar CSS which is compiled when you go to the Rich Text app is the exact same CSS which will be used when you go to the Code/Markdown app. This feature is available in the `staging` branch of the CryptPad project and will be on CryptPad.fr in the next release.\n\nWe could make it even faster, by separating the main content of the Less files from the `.<filename>_vars()` and `.<filename>_main()` mixins, essentially making header files, in C/C++ parlance. And if we find in future profiling that less compiling remains a signficant performance penalty, there's a good chance that we will.\n","slug":"Making-CryptPad-CSS-3-times-faster-by-loading-it-twice","published":1,"updated":"2018-12-10T16:17:07.987Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cktsjy9up0013cya8venvpvcm","content":"<script src=\"https://cryptpad.fr/common/media-tag-nacl.min.js\"></script>\n\n<p>In CryptPad development, we have always tried to push the limits of the technology. As you might know, we don’t minify any of our javascript code and we have no build system, yet CryptPad is still faster than many similar projects which do. In recent profiling, we determined that the biggest cause of slow loading was compilng of less stylesheets.</p>\n<p>All of the styles for CryptPad are written in <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Less</a> CSS templating language and because we don’t have a build system, when you load a page on CryptPad, it downloads the less compiler and runs it in your browser. When the less has been compiled the first time, it is cached in the browser’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">localStorage</a> so that it doesn’t need to be compiled again (until next release). Unfortunately, the way we structured CryptPad Less code led to this taking a long time.</p>\n<p>CSS by its nature is very much like object inheritence, a design pattern popular in the 1990s which has <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-85233-856-3_23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since</a> <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/inheritance-is-evil-stop-using-it-6c4f1caf5117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">been</a> <a href=\"http://neethack.com/2017/04/Why-inheritance-is-bad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discredited</a>. In a bid to keep our styles under control, we decided to make heavy use of Less <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mixins</a>. The idea was that we didn’t want our CSS code to “speak until it was spoken to”.</p>\n<p>Something like the following would be very problematic if it were dumped on the global scope, but it is never output until it is called:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.example_header() &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    a &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: red;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>So then the code which uses it can invoke it only in the exact place where it ought to be used.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">@include &quot;example.less&quot;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.cp-app-pad &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .cp-padheader &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        .cp-padheader-left &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            .example_header();</span><br><span class=\"line\">        &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>If you’re a CSS purist, you’re probably pulling your hair out now, because <em>the right way</em> is to use html classes. The thing is, we do, but because CryptPad is made up of many different pieces of open source software, we cannot control all of the HTML and sometimes things <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/2.4.0/customize.dist/src/less2/include/ckeditor-fix.less\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aren’t so simple</a>. Using mixins gave us an extra layer of safety and allowed us to write CSS feeling quite confident that it would not end up changing things where it wasn’t supposed to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Strip-CSS-respect-650-finalenglish1.jpg\"></p>\n<center data-yeah-i-know-a-center-tag=\"so sue me\"><em>Cascading works great, until you include one CSS file that was written by this guy.</em></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"Parameterized-mixins\"><a href=\"#Parameterized-mixins\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Parameterized mixins\"></a>Parameterized mixins</h2><p>An excellent feature of Less is parameterized mixins, that is, templates with arguments. One of our biggest templates is called <code>.toolbar_main()</code> and this builds the toolbar at the top of CryptPad as well as the user-list on the lefthand side. In order to make the customizable colors with the same HTML structure, we opted to use a parameterized mixin like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.toolbar_main (</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @color: @colortheme_default-color, // Color of the text for the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg, // color of the toolbar background</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @warn-color: @colortheme_default-warn, // color of the warning text in the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @barWidth: 600px // width of the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">/// a lot of code here, using colors based on the parameters,</span><br><span class=\"line\">/// but lightened or darkened using less functions.</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then each app would call <code>.toolbar_main()</code> with its own color parameters, and get a nice toolbar, customized to that app’s color theme. Again, this is not the only way to do it, but having the ability to generate CSS with highly specific color rules proved to be extremely useful for overriding leaked styles coming from the software that we integrate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"State-explosion\"><a href=\"#State-explosion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"State explosion\"></a>State explosion</h2><p>What we didn’t think about at that time was the effect that the proliferation of CryptPad Apps would have on the amount of CSS being generated. We started with just a few styles and just a few apps to apply those styles on.</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/ba/baf60fc13e35117c60337bbd93ee1dd43ede9280fe5aa583\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:9nEx58X4nrmTYmi5i8K8bb6DvTRemmYubZbU1J1dDa0=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>But as we added more and more CryptPad apps, the same CSS was being generated and applied over and over…</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/1b/1b5e6189a55efb7ea30ff1cc128597ce76b158fd659d6f45\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:tvxTuU3P5nqqQ75TMRsjehvOjljlkSGzpZTgrfhgGSg=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>Then as our styles become more complex, the CSS which was being copy/pasted by less compiler became bigger and bigger</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/83/8398106a4ee0109630793846cabfdecaa8ee80313cca7e37\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:qy+1nKYU8sQiQR88IgqyxAfspxZiEN8Q3NkBI2qpPOA=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>The total of all our less code in the entire project was only 235k, and it was compiling to over <strong>1.3 megabytes of CSS</strong>. We cache the compiled CSS by placing it in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">localStorage</a>, but still, every time a new version of CryptPad was released, the CSS needed to be recompiled and this was dominating the loading time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building-a-Linker-for-CSS\"><a href=\"#Building-a-Linker-for-CSS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Building a Linker for CSS\"></a>Building a Linker for CSS</h2><p>If you have experience with C/C++, you might recognize this problem. It is as if there was no linker and the only way to reuse code was to use preprocessor <code>#include</code> over and over again.</p>\n<p>Since by this point, we had a significant amount of Less which was designed this way, rewriting it was not an option, so we started looking for ways to <em>link</em> it rather than copy/pasting it over and over again. Fortunately most of the bigger mixins only applied rules to specific classes, so moving them up to the root level would not cause trouble, though to be safe, we wanted to only load the styles that were necessary.</p>\n<p>If we would indicate to the javascript code which loaded the Less that a particular Less file was needed, it could be compiled, cached and included <em>separately</em>, and thus it could be reused across apps. In order to keep the Less API as close to the same as possible, we decided to put that indication inside of the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin.</p>\n<p>So <code>.dropdown_main()</code> went from this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.dropdown_main () &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // all the code here</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>To this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.dropdown_main () &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // all the code here</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Two important things to note: firstly <code>LessLoader_currentFile()</code> is a function which we created (as the name implies, it’s defined in <code>LessLoader.js</code>), it simply expands to the current function name. Secondly, when a less file is included with the <code>reference</code> flag (e.g. <code>@include (reference) &quot;./dropdown.less&quot;;</code>) the content is not output but the mixins are made available, so moving the code down to the bottom of <code>dropdown.less</code> would cause it not to end up in the compilation of <code>app-pad.less</code>.</p>\n<p>The resulting CSS from this contains something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">--LessLoader_require: &quot;/customize/src/less/include/dropdown.less&quot;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>LessLoader would then simply scan for <code>--LessLoader_require:</code> and trigger loading of those files, which are still parsed by Less, but are the same for every CryptPad app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Parameters-with-CSS-variables\"><a href=\"#Parameters-with-CSS-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Parameters with CSS variables\"></a>Parameters with CSS variables</h3><p>In this example, I intentionally left out the parameterized mixins. Solving this was slightly more complicated and in order to do it, we made use of a reasonably new feature in web browsers: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CSS variables</a>. </p>\n<p>Today, one can write in CSS the following:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">:root &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --color-should-be: brown;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// potentially much later...</span><br><span class=\"line\">.element &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    color: var(--color-should-be);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>and the element text will be brown. Discovering this was a breakthrough because it meant that the arguments could be turned into variables in <code>app-pad.less</code> and then made use of in <code>toolbar.less</code>. However, there are limitations to what you can do with CSS variables. For example, this doesn’t work:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">:root &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --hack-boolean: 1;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// later on...</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">@media screen and (max-width: calc(var(--hack-boolean) * 100000000)) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // HAHAHA I MADE AN IF STATEMENT</span><br><span class=\"line\">    :root &#123; --lets-define-another-variable: &quot;lol&quot;; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<center><em>If this worked, I’d probably be using it</em></center>\n\n<p><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"Scoped-CSS-variables\"><a href=\"#Scoped-CSS-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scoped CSS variables\"></a>Scoped CSS variables</h4><p>What does work, however, is specifying different values of the same variable at different scopes, so this does work:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.my-button &#123; --button-color: red; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.my-popup-window .my-button &#123; --button-color: blue; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// later on...</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">.my-button &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    background-color: var(--button-color);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>But possible uses/abuses of this feature were not investigated.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Making-it-work\"><a href=\"#Making-it-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making it work\"></a>Making it work</h4><p>Following the general principle of <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keeping the variable definition close to the usage</a>, we put the variable definitions inside of the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin and the usages below in the same file. In order to avoid namespace collisons, we prefixed all variables with the name of the file. A simplified version of avatar.less looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.avatar_main(@width) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --avatar-width: @width;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &amp;.cp-avatar &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        ...</span><br><span class=\"line\">        .cp-avatar-default, media-tag &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            width: var(--avatar-width);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In some cases, we needed to introduce additional variables because of the use of Less functions such as <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lighten() and darken()</a>, which obviously cannot work on CSS variables.

With our approximately 4500 unique users per week, this is a little over 1%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Making-an-acceptable-fallback\"><a href=\"#Making-an-acceptable-fallback\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making an acceptable fallback\"></a>Making an acceptable fallback</h3><p>The One Percent jokes asside, it’s hard to justify making CryptPad 300% slower for everyone who tries it for the first time, just to satisfy about 1% of the userbase. But at the same time, it’s sad to drop support for a browser which at the current moment does work with CryptPad.</p>\n<p>The solution we devised was to specify default values and then override them.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.cp-markdown-toolbar &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    ...</span><br><span class=\"line\">    button &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        // IE sees this (variable compiled by less)</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: @toolbar-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        </span><br><span class=\"line\">        // everyone else sees this</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: var(--toolbar-color);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The only question remaining was how to specify the defaults in a way that was simple for us when we worked on the less files. Most of our <code>.&lt;filemane&gt;_main()</code> parameterized mixins already had default values in case they were called without parameters, so we already knew what sane defaults would be. What we decided to do was create a new mixin called <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_vars()</code>, which would assign a set of Less variables based on the arguments.</p>\n<p>The final result looked like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.help_vars (</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @color: @colortheme_default-color,</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg</span><br><span class=\"line\">) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.help_main (@color, @bg-color) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .help_vars(@color, @bg-color);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .help_vars();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .cp-help-container &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">        position: relative;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        background-color: @help-bg-color-l15;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        background-color: var(--help-bg-color-l15);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Going through it step-by-step, the <code>.help_vars()</code> mixin takes parameters but it defines default values, then it creates some Less variables which are accessed after it is used. <code>.help_main()</code> calls <code>.help_vars()</code> and passes it arguments, then takes it’s results and assigns them to CSS variables. Then the main block of the Less file also calls <code>.help_vars()</code> but without any arguments, so the defaults are used. Then in the main block, each usage of a CSS variable also has the usage of the less variable. The less variable provides the default value, the one which IE will see, and then the CSS variable provides the specified value, the one which will be different per CryptPad application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"There-you-have-it\"><a href=\"#There-you-have-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"There you have it\"></a>There you have it</h2><p>Every Less file now gets loaded twice, first it is loaded by the <code>@include (reference)</code> call, where it is parsed in order to expose the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin, then it is loaded a second time as an independent file. Importantly, however, once it is compiled it is stored into localStorage and the toolbar CSS which is compiled when you go to the Rich Text app is the exact same CSS which will be used when you go to the Code/Markdown app. This feature is available in the <code>staging</code> branch of the CryptPad project and will be on CryptPad.fr in the next release.</p>\n<p>We could make it even faster, by separating the main content of the Less files from the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_vars()</code> and <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixins, essentially making header files, in C/C++ parlance. And if we find in future profiling that less compiling remains a signficant performance penalty, there’s a good chance that we will.</p>\n","site":{"data":{}},"excerpt":"","more":"<script src=\"https://cryptpad.fr/common/media-tag-nacl.min.js\"></script>\n\n<p>In CryptPad development, we have always tried to push the limits of the technology. As you might know, we don’t minify any of our javascript code and we have no build system, yet CryptPad is still faster than many similar projects which do. In recent profiling, we determined that the biggest cause of slow loading was compilng of less stylesheets.</p>\n<p>All of the styles for CryptPad are written in <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Less</a> CSS templating language and because we don’t have a build system, when you load a page on CryptPad, it downloads the less compiler and runs it in your browser. When the less has been compiled the first time, it is cached in the browser’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">localStorage</a> so that it doesn’t need to be compiled again (until next release). Unfortunately, the way we structured CryptPad Less code led to this taking a long time.</p>\n<p>CSS by its nature is very much like object inheritence, a design pattern popular in the 1990s which has <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-85233-856-3_23\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">since</a> <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/inheritance-is-evil-stop-using-it-6c4f1caf5117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">been</a> <a href=\"http://neethack.com/2017/04/Why-inheritance-is-bad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">discredited</a>. In a bid to keep our styles under control, we decided to make heavy use of Less <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/features/#mixins-feature\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mixins</a>. The idea was that we didn’t want our CSS code to “speak until it was spoken to”.</p>\n<p>Something like the following would be very problematic if it were dumped on the global scope, but it is never output until it is called:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.example_header() &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    a &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: red;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>So then the code which uses it can invoke it only in the exact place where it ought to be used.</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">@include &quot;example.less&quot;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.cp-app-pad &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .cp-padheader &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        .cp-padheader-left &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            .example_header();</span><br><span class=\"line\">        &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>If you’re a CSS purist, you’re probably pulling your hair out now, because <em>the right way</em> is to use html classes. The thing is, we do, but because CryptPad is made up of many different pieces of open source software, we cannot control all of the HTML and sometimes things <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/2.4.0/customize.dist/src/less2/include/ckeditor-fix.less\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">aren’t so simple</a>. Using mixins gave us an extra layer of safety and allowed us to write CSS feeling quite confident that it would not end up changing things where it wasn’t supposed to.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/Strip-CSS-respect-650-finalenglish1.jpg\"></p>\n<center data-yeah-i-know-a-center-tag=\"so sue me\"><em>Cascading works great, until you include one CSS file that was written by this guy.</em></center>\n\n<h2 id=\"Parameterized-mixins\"><a href=\"#Parameterized-mixins\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Parameterized mixins\"></a>Parameterized mixins</h2><p>An excellent feature of Less is parameterized mixins, that is, templates with arguments. One of our biggest templates is called <code>.toolbar_main()</code> and this builds the toolbar at the top of CryptPad as well as the user-list on the lefthand side. In order to make the customizable colors with the same HTML structure, we opted to use a parameterized mixin like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.toolbar_main (</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @color: @colortheme_default-color, // Color of the text for the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg, // color of the toolbar background</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @warn-color: @colortheme_default-warn, // color of the warning text in the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @barWidth: 600px // width of the toolbar</span><br><span class=\"line\">) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">/// a lot of code here, using colors based on the parameters,</span><br><span class=\"line\">/// but lightened or darkened using less functions.</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Then each app would call <code>.toolbar_main()</code> with its own color parameters, and get a nice toolbar, customized to that app’s color theme. Again, this is not the only way to do it, but having the ability to generate CSS with highly specific color rules proved to be extremely useful for overriding leaked styles coming from the software that we integrate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"State-explosion\"><a href=\"#State-explosion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"State explosion\"></a>State explosion</h2><p>What we didn’t think about at that time was the effect that the proliferation of CryptPad Apps would have on the amount of CSS being generated. We started with just a few styles and just a few apps to apply those styles on.</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/ba/baf60fc13e35117c60337bbd93ee1dd43ede9280fe5aa583\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:9nEx58X4nrmTYmi5i8K8bb6DvTRemmYubZbU1J1dDa0=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>But as we added more and more CryptPad apps, the same CSS was being generated and applied over and over…</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/1b/1b5e6189a55efb7ea30ff1cc128597ce76b158fd659d6f45\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:tvxTuU3P5nqqQ75TMRsjehvOjljlkSGzpZTgrfhgGSg=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>Then as our styles become more complex, the CSS which was being copy/pasted by less compiler became bigger and bigger</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/83/8398106a4ee0109630793846cabfdecaa8ee80313cca7e37\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:qy+1nKYU8sQiQR88IgqyxAfspxZiEN8Q3NkBI2qpPOA=\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>The total of all our less code in the entire project was only 235k, and it was compiling to over <strong>1.3 megabytes of CSS</strong>. We cache the compiled CSS by placing it in <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">localStorage</a>, but still, every time a new version of CryptPad was released, the CSS needed to be recompiled and this was dominating the loading time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Building-a-Linker-for-CSS\"><a href=\"#Building-a-Linker-for-CSS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Building a Linker for CSS\"></a>Building a Linker for CSS</h2><p>If you have experience with C/C++, you might recognize this problem. It is as if there was no linker and the only way to reuse code was to use preprocessor <code>#include</code> over and over again.</p>\n<p>Since by this point, we had a significant amount of Less which was designed this way, rewriting it was not an option, so we started looking for ways to <em>link</em> it rather than copy/pasting it over and over again. Fortunately most of the bigger mixins only applied rules to specific classes, so moving them up to the root level would not cause trouble, though to be safe, we wanted to only load the styles that were necessary.</p>\n<p>If we would indicate to the javascript code which loaded the Less that a particular Less file was needed, it could be compiled, cached and included <em>separately</em>, and thus it could be reused across apps. In order to keep the Less API as close to the same as possible, we decided to put that indication inside of the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin.</p>\n<p>So <code>.dropdown_main()</code> went from this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.dropdown_main () &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // all the code here</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>To this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.dropdown_main () &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // all the code here</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Two important things to note: firstly <code>LessLoader_currentFile()</code> is a function which we created (as the name implies, it’s defined in <code>LessLoader.js</code>), it simply expands to the current function name. Secondly, when a less file is included with the <code>reference</code> flag (e.g. <code>@include (reference) &quot;./dropdown.less&quot;;</code>) the content is not output but the mixins are made available, so moving the code down to the bottom of <code>dropdown.less</code> would cause it not to end up in the compilation of <code>app-pad.less</code>.</p>\n<p>The resulting CSS from this contains something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">--LessLoader_require: &quot;/customize/src/less/include/dropdown.less&quot;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>LessLoader would then simply scan for <code>--LessLoader_require:</code> and trigger loading of those files, which are still parsed by Less, but are the same for every CryptPad app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Parameters-with-CSS-variables\"><a href=\"#Parameters-with-CSS-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Parameters with CSS variables\"></a>Parameters with CSS variables</h3><p>In this example, I intentionally left out the parameterized mixins. Solving this was slightly more complicated and in order to do it, we made use of a reasonably new feature in web browsers: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CSS variables</a>. </p>\n<p>Today, one can write in CSS the following:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">:root &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --color-should-be: brown;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// potentially much later...</span><br><span class=\"line\">.element &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    color: var(--color-should-be);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>and the element text will be brown. Discovering this was a breakthrough because it meant that the arguments could be turned into variables in <code>app-pad.less</code> and then made use of in <code>toolbar.less</code>. However, there are limitations to what you can do with CSS variables. For example, this doesn’t work:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">:root &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --hack-boolean: 1;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// later on...</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">@media screen and (max-width: calc(var(--hack-boolean) * 100000000)) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    // HAHAHA I MADE AN IF STATEMENT</span><br><span class=\"line\">    :root &#123; --lets-define-another-variable: &quot;lol&quot;; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<center><em>If this worked, I’d probably be using it</em></center>\n\n<p><br></p>\n<h4 id=\"Scoped-CSS-variables\"><a href=\"#Scoped-CSS-variables\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scoped CSS variables\"></a>Scoped CSS variables</h4><p>What does work, however, is specifying different values of the same variable at different scopes, so this does work:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.my-button &#123; --button-color: red; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.my-popup-window .my-button &#123; --button-color: blue; &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">// later on...</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">.my-button &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    background-color: var(--button-color);</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>But possible uses/abuses of this feature were not investigated.</p>\n<h4 id=\"Making-it-work\"><a href=\"#Making-it-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making it work\"></a>Making it work</h4><p>Following the general principle of <a href=\"https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keeping the variable definition close to the usage</a>, we put the variable definitions inside of the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin and the usages below in the same file. In order to avoid namespace collisons, we prefixed all variables with the name of the file. A simplified version of avatar.less looks like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.avatar_main(@width) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --avatar-width: @width;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &amp;.cp-avatar &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        ...</span><br><span class=\"line\">        .cp-avatar-default, media-tag &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">            width: var(--avatar-width);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>In some cases, we needed to introduce additional variables because of the use of Less functions such as <a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/#color-operations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lighten() and darken()</a>, which obviously cannot work on CSS variables. So we used the following pattern in many places:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.help_main (@color, @bg-color) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<h3 id=\"Results\"><a href=\"#Results\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Results\"></a>Results</h3><p>After carefully planning and studying solutions, we managed a fairly non-invasive refactoring of the styles which took Less compile time down from almost 3 seconds to around 900ms. For simplistic pages like the front page, the number dropped to around 200ms.</p>\n<p>The key result is that a person who has never seen CryptPad before will see the main page right away instead of waiting 3 or more seconds to compile all the less for the entire project.</p>\n<h2 id=\"But-wait-what-about-Internet-Explorer\"><a href=\"#But-wait-what-about-Internet-Explorer\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"But wait, what about Internet Explorer ?\"></a>But wait, what about Internet Explorer ?</h2><p>This question is the bane of many web developers’ existance. In this case, the problem is that <a href=\"https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/csscustompropertiesakacssvariables/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Internet Explorer has no CSS variables</a>. Last week we changed CryptPad so that when you use it, your browser will let us know if it doesn’t support CSS variables. This is done using the <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/07/07/cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know/#What-we-collect-because-we-want-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feedback mechanism</a> which is an opt-out collection of information such as how often particular features are used and whether certain things are supported by the browsers of people using CryptPad.</p>\n<p>What we found is that in the past week, we saw about 50 unique users who are running browsers which don’t support CSS variables. With our approximately 4500 unique users per week, this is a little over 1%.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Making-an-acceptable-fallback\"><a href=\"#Making-an-acceptable-fallback\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Making an acceptable fallback\"></a>Making an acceptable fallback</h3><p>The One Percent jokes asside, it’s hard to justify making CryptPad 300% slower for everyone who tries it for the first time, just to satisfy about 1% of the userbase. But at the same time, it’s sad to drop support for a browser which at the current moment does work with CryptPad.</p>\n<p>The solution we devised was to specify default values and then override them.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.cp-markdown-toolbar &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    ...</span><br><span class=\"line\">    button &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        // IE sees this (variable compiled by less)</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: @toolbar-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        </span><br><span class=\"line\">        // everyone else sees this</span><br><span class=\"line\">        color: var(--toolbar-color);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>The only question remaining was how to specify the defaults in a way that was simple for us when we worked on the less files. Most of our <code>.&lt;filemane&gt;_main()</code> parameterized mixins already had default values in case they were called without parameters, so we already knew what sane defaults would be. What we decided to do was create a new mixin called <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_vars()</code>, which would assign a set of Less variables based on the arguments.</p>\n<p>The final result looked like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">.help_vars (</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @color: @colortheme_default-color,</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @bg-color: @colortheme_default-bg</span><br><span class=\"line\">) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-bg-color-l15: lighten(@bg-color, 15%);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-text-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, #fff, #000); //@color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    @help-link-color: contrast(@help-bg-color-l15, lighten(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%), darken(spin(@bg-color, 180), 10%));</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">.help_main (@color, @bg-color) &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --LessLoader_require: LessLoader_currentFile();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .help_vars(@color, @bg-color);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-bg-color-l15: @help-bg-color-l15;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-text-color: @help-text-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    --help-link-color: @help-link-color;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&amp; &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .help_vars();</span><br><span class=\"line\">    .cp-help-container &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">        position: relative;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        background-color: @help-bg-color-l15;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        background-color: var(--help-bg-color-l15);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Going through it step-by-step, the <code>.help_vars()</code> mixin takes parameters but it defines default values, then it creates some Less variables which are accessed after it is used. <code>.help_main()</code> calls <code>.help_vars()</code> and passes it arguments, then takes it’s results and assigns them to CSS variables. Then the main block of the Less file also calls <code>.help_vars()</code> but without any arguments, so the defaults are used. Then in the main block, each usage of a CSS variable also has the usage of the less variable. The less variable provides the default value, the one which IE will see, and then the CSS variable provides the specified value, the one which will be different per CryptPad application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"There-you-have-it\"><a href=\"#There-you-have-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"There you have it\"></a>There you have it</h2><p>Every Less file now gets loaded twice, first it is loaded by the <code>@include (reference)</code> call, where it is parsed in order to expose the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixin, then it is loaded a second time as an independent file. Importantly, however, once it is compiled it is stored into localStorage and the toolbar CSS which is compiled when you go to the Rich Text app is the exact same CSS which will be used when you go to the Code/Markdown app. This feature is available in the <code>staging</code> branch of the CryptPad project and will be on CryptPad.fr in the next release.</p>\n<p>We could make it even faster, by separating the main content of the Less files from the <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_vars()</code> and <code>.&lt;filename&gt;_main()</code> mixins, essentially making header files, in C/C++ parlance. And if we find in future profiling that less compiling remains a signficant performance penalty, there’s a good chance that we will.</p>\n"},{"title":"No plan survives first contact with the

had some worries about how we would continue to fund our team, but we were fortunate enough to meet and form a good relationship with members of Europe's [Next Generation Internet Initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/).\n\nWe received 50000 Euros from [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) as a part of their [NGI0 Privacy Enhancing Technologies](https://nlnet.nl/PET/) grant program.\nThough we'd planned to finish this project ([CryptPad Teams](https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad/)) before the end of 2019, research projects at this scale require a faster pace than we were used to.\nWe'd had an intern join our team over the summer, our plan didn't really account for vacation days, another salaried worker joined our team in November, and in general there were just many distractions that made everything take a bit longer than expected\n\nWe mostly made up a lot of the difference with an increasing number of [donations](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad) and subscriptions via our [premium accounts portal](https://cryptpad.fr/accounts/), and we had written a number of new grant proposals for the coming year.\nOur second NLnet proposal ([CryptPad for Communities](https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad-Communities/)) had already been accepted, but we were waiting to sign the final contract before making any announcements.\nSo, with 2020 on the horizon I wrote [an article](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/12/31/Looking-back-looking-forward/) which alluded to our plans while we waited to hear back about which of our remaining proposals would be accepted.\n\n## 2020's projects\n\nIn early 2020 we were still finishing up the final components of _CryptPad Teams_.\nIn addition to the remaining technical features we were also required to complete two audits of the platform: one to assess CryptPad's accessibility and another quick scan of its security features.\nWe didn't really know how long these would take, and we hadn't budgeted additional time for them, so these delayed our other projects and added a little bit to our 2019 deficit.\n\nWe already knew to expect another 50000 Euros from NLnet for our _Communities_ project, but since the status of our other proposals was still uncertain we decided to attend the [Open-Source Speed Dating session](https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/events/open-source-speed-dating-fosdem-2020-96f78c6c) at [FOSDEM](https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/).\nTwo of our team members pitched a project to speed up CryptPad's page loading times, making for a total of three pending proposals.\n\nAs it turned out, we heard about all three projects in the space of a few days and all three were accepted.\nWe weren't expecting all of these proposals to be successful, so we had to adjust a lot of our plans to ensure we could manage all of their respective deadlines, but on paper it all seemed manageable.\n\n### CryptPad for communities\n\nWe'd already begun working on **Communities**' features quite early in the year.\nThe project included a number of high-level themes, but the overall goal was to make it easier for groups of various sizes to adopt or transition to CryptPad instead of proprietary alternatives.\n\nFirstly, we'd heard from small businesses and social initiatives that they wanted to use CryptPad but needed some new features before they could make the switch.\nWe made major changes to our Kanban, rich text, and spreadsheet editors.\n\nCryptPad's admin panel, which used to be very limited, now features a variety of controls for adding or modifying quotas for particular users, along with a variety of other configuration options to make it easier to run your own CryptPad instance.\nWe still need to add the ability to restrict registration and unregistered usage, but we expect to deliver this in early 2021.\n\nFinally, we launched [our documentation platform](https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/), which is available in English, French, and (courtesy of some dedicated contributors) German.\nThere is currently only a user guide, but we'll soon offer a thorough installation guide for admins and some technical documentation for contributors.\n\n### Secure Mobile Collaboration\n\nThe goal of this project was to experiment with different technologies and ultimately prototype some dedicated mobile and desktop apps for CryptPad.\nOur intent was to make CryptPad usable on mobile devices while also improving security by distributing static builds of our source code with cryptographic signatures so their authenticity could be verified.\n\nWe pitched this project to [NGI TRUST](https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-trust/) at the end of November 2019 and framed it as an experiment since we weren't sure we'd be able to maintain dedicated apps in addition to the web platform we already offer.\nNevertheless, we know that mobile support is important to our users and we wanted to dedicate time to investigate our options.\n\nWe expect to finish this project soon but our approach has diverged from its early goals in some very notable ways.\nFor now I'll just say that a lot of time and effort has gone towards addressing the intended problems and that you can expect a dedicated blog post or two about this in the near future.\n\n### Dialogue\n\nNot long after proposing _Communities_ to NLnet we pitched this third _PET_ project.\nIt can take several months for these proposals to pass through their various stages of review, and each project only funds our team for part of the year, so it's important that we line up our next project before the current ones finish.\nAt the same time, we can't (legally) get paid by multiple funding bodies for the same work, so we need to ensure that projects don't overlap.\n\nWe applied for this and the NGI TRUST grant concurrently, but we didn't expect to win both.\nNLnet's deadlines are considerably less strict, however, so we've prioritized SMC and saved [Dialogue](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/) for the coming year.\nAll _NGI0 PET_ projects have to be completed by late 2021, so we expect this to be our last.\n\nCryptPad is currently specialized mostly for real-time document editing, and our cryptographic permissions system reflects that.\nThe main idea behind this project is to develop a new set of applications with different permission schemes that support more granular permissions for document components instead of all-or-nothing permissions for whole documents.\n\nWe already offer a _poll_ application, but it uses the same _editor/viewer_ roles as our document editors, which really doesn't match users' expectations.\nThis current implementation will be phased out in favour of the new scheme to support distinct roles for authors (who can ask questions and determine who can answer them), responders (who can submit answers), and viewers (who can see responses).\nWe're also going to add support for more complex surveys with multiple questions, implement a reminder system to notify authors and viewers when their polls have closed, and add some more instance admin functionality so that we and other people hosting CryptPad can communicate with their users via the existing notification system.\n\n### MOSS\n\nThe requirements of [Mozilla's Open-Source Support](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) program were considerably less formal than those of NLnet and NGI TRUST.\nWe received 10000 USD, which converted to about 9000 Euros at the time we received it, and we promised to use it to improve page loading times.\nThere wasn't any contract or formal definition of how we'd planned to do this, and no deadline given.\n\nThis funding model was extremely helpful for us this year and did a fantastic job of living up to its name and goal of supporting open-source.\nOur European funding partners provide all or most of their financial support as their deliverables or the entire project are completed.\nBy contrast, MOSS solved some immediate cash-flow issues during this difficult year and afforded us the flexibility to fulfill our promises in between our other deadlines.\n\nSo far we've followed up on these goals by profiling page loading times on different devices to determine where to best spend our efforts.\nWe've made a number of small optimizations on the client along with some big server improvements that were frequently the cause of bottlenecks when establishing a new connection to the server.\nThere's still much more to do in this regard, and we plan to post ongoing updates as we find more room for improvement.\n\n## A year of surprises\n\nWith the exception of our MOSS grant, everything I've mentioned so far was planned and proposed late in 2019.\nWe'd set our objectives for 2020 early on and had carefully considered how we could coordinate our multiple projects and how their features could complement each other.\nAs you might imagine, very little went according to plan.\n\ni vaguely recall a few headlines about a respiratory illness being discovered in China late last year, but I didn't give it much thought and obviously didn't foresee the impact it would have on our plans for the year, let alone everything else it affected.\nAs the epidemic became more widespread, was upgraded to pandemic status, and triggered lockdowns across the world increasingly more people moved to working online.\nPreviously, I was happy with our success when we saw ten to fifteen thousand users in a week, but those numbers quickly doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in a matter of months as offices and classrooms started relying heavily on our platform.\n\n![Unique IPs per visiting CryptPad.fr per day](/images/2020-users.png)\n\nWe made some significant changes to our server code to keep up with demand and eliminated some of our client's code that was particularly expensive for the server.\nThe precise technical details of exactly what we did to adapt to the dramatic increase in usage deserve their own article, but in general we suddenly had to pay a lot more attention to our infrastructure than was previously the case.\nWe started regularly allocating more disk space to the server and, as 2020 ends, we now store more than six times more user data than we did this time last year.\n\nOne major lesson we've learned, however, is that it's been far easier to scale our infrastructure than manual support for the platform.\nOur surge of new users came along with a matching increase in support tickets, emails, GitHub iissues, and questions on social media.\nWe prioritized the documentation that we were writing as a part of our _Communities_ project, however, we still had to take time to answer the questions of people who hadn't found those docs or whose questions were not clearly answered therein.\n\nWe're still working to streamline this process, but our ability to respond to individual questions is a frequent bottleneck for our team.\nThis typically makes it more difficult to stay on top of our usual development cycle, and leaves less time than we'd like for promoting the project via public events or blog articles.\nHaving too many users is a fantastic problem to have, though, so this is less a complaint and more an acknowledgement of a challenge that we need to address.\nWe can't afford to be just _a team of software developers_ that also happen to _maintain and support a platform_ when both activities are equally important to our continued success.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAfter the year we've had it's tempting to view the future as increasingly uncertain, but the reality is that nothing was ever certain to begin with.\nWe're still making plans for 2021, but our plans now include more caveats and fallbacks to (hopefully) lessen the impact of whatever else we don't see coming.\n\nWith all the unexpected stress of this year it's difficult to remember the good things, but we've had an incredible increase in support from our users.\nContributors have helped to add some significant features to the platform this year and have [translated CryptPad](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/) into a number of languages.\nIn the past two months subscriptions and donations have covered one of our three team members' salaries.\nOur yearly revenue has once again _more than doubled_ compared to the previous twelve months, and if these trend continues we'll be able to fund our current team's salaries without having to depend on grants.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about our goals for the future, but we still have a number of projects to complete, so for now I'll prefer not to think too far ahead.\nInstead, I'll leave you with a bit of a teaser for our upcoming 4.0.0 release...\n\n![CryptPad 4.0.0, coming in January 2021!](/images/NYE-2020.png)\n\nThanks so much to everyone who's supported us in any way throughout this difficult year.\n\nWe wish you all the best in 2021!\n","source":"_posts/No-plan-survives-first-contact-with-the-enemy.md","raw":"---\ntitle: No plan survives first contact with the enemy\ndate:

the good things, but we've had an incredible increase in support from our users.\nContributors have helped to add some significant features to the platform this year and have [translated CryptPad](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/) into a number of languages.\nIn the past two months subscriptions and donations have covered one of our three team members' salaries.\nOur yearly revenue has once again _more than doubled_ compared to the previous twelve months, and if these trend continues we'll be able to fund our current team's salaries without having to depend on grants.\n\nThere's a lot more to be said about our goals for the future, but we still have a number of projects to complete, so for now I'll prefer not to think too far ahead.\nInstead, I'll leave you with a bit of a teaser for our upcoming 4.0.0 release...\n\n![CryptPad 4.0.0, coming in January 2021!](/images/NYE-2020.png)\n\nThanks so much to everyone who's supported us in any way throughout this difficult year.\n\nWe wish you all the best in

2019 we finished a four-year research project that had covered the majority of CryptPad’s development costs.\nWe had some worries about how we would continue to fund our team, but we were fortunate

with an increasing number of <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/cryptpad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">donations</a> and subscriptions via our <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/accounts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">premium accounts portal</a>, and we had written a number of new grant proposals for the coming year.\nOur second NLnet proposal (<a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad-Communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CryptPad for Communities</a>) had already been accepted, but we were waiting to sign the final contract before making any announcements.\nSo, with 2020 on the horizon I wrote <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/12/31/Looking-back-looking-forward/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an article</a> which alluded to our plans while we waited to hear back about which of our remaining proposals would be accepted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2020’s-projects\"><a href=\"#2020’s-projects\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2020’s projects\"></a>2020’s projects</h2><p>In early 2020 we were still finishing up the final components of <em>CryptPad Teams</em>.\nIn addition to the remaining technical features we were also required to complete two audits of the platform: one to assess CryptPad’s accessibility and another quick scan of its security features.\nWe didn’t really know how long these would take, and we hadn’t budgeted additional time for them, so these delayed our other projects and added a little bit to our 2019 deficit.</p>\n<p>We already knew to expect another 50000 Euros from NLnet for our <em>Communities</em> project, but since the status of our other proposals was still uncertain we decided to attend the <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/open-source-speed-dating/events/open-source-speed-dating-fosdem-2020-96f78c6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Open-Source Speed Dating session</a> at <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2020/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FOSDEM</a>.\nTwo of our team members pitched a project to speed up CryptPad’s page loading times, making for a total of three pending proposals.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, we heard about all three projects in the space of a few days and all three were accepted.\nWe weren’t expecting all of these proposals to be successful, so we had to adjust a lot of our plans to ensure we could manage all of their respective deadlines, but on paper it all seemed manageable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"CryptPad-for-communities\"><a href=\"#CryptPad-for-communities\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"CryptPad for communities\"></a>CryptPad for communities</h3><p>We’d already begun working on <strong>Communities</strong>‘ features quite early in the year.\nThe project included a number of high-level themes, but the overall goal was to make it easier for groups of various sizes to adopt or transition to CryptPad instead of proprietary alternatives.</p>\n<p>Firstly, we’d heard from small businesses and social initiatives that they wanted to use CryptPad but needed some new features before they could make the switch.\nWe made major changes to our Kanban, rich text, and spreadsheet editors.</p>\n<p>CryptPad’s admin panel, which used to be very limited, now features a variety of controls for adding or modifying quotas for particular users, along with a variety of other configuration options to make it easier to run your own CryptPad instance.\nWe still need to add the ability to restrict registration and unregistered usage, but we expect to deliver this in early 2021.</p>\n<p>Finally, we launched <a href=\"https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our documentation platform</a>, which is available in English, French, and (courtesy of some dedicated contributors) German.\nThere is currently only a user guide, but we’ll soon offer a thorough installation guide for admins and some technical documentation for contributors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Secure-Mobile-Collaboration\"><a href=\"#Secure-Mobile-Collaboration\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Secure Mobile Collaboration\"></a>Secure Mobile Collaboration</h3><p>The goal of this project was to experiment with different technologies and ultimately prototype some dedicated mobile and desktop apps for CryptPad.\nOur intent was to make CryptPad usable on mobile devices while also improving security by distributing static builds of our source code with cryptographic signatures so their authenticity could be verified.</p>\n<p>We pitched this project to <a href=\"https://www.ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi-trust/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NGI TRUST</a> at the end of November 2019 and framed it as an experiment since we weren’t sure we’d be able to maintain dedicated apps in addition to the web platform we already offer.\nNevertheless, we know that mobile support is important to our users and we wanted to dedicate time to investigate our options.</p>\n<p>We expect to finish this project soon but our approach has diverged from its early goals in some very notable ways.\nFor now I’ll just say that a lot of time and effort has gone towards addressing the intended problems and that you can expect a dedicated blog post or two about this in the near future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Dialogue\"><a href=\"#Dialogue\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Dialogue\"></a>Dialogue</h3><p>Not long after proposing <em>Communities</em> to NLnet we pitched this third <em>PET</em> project.\nIt can take several months for these proposals to pass through their various stages of review, and each project only funds our team for part of the year, so it’s important that we line up our next project before the current ones finish.\nAt the same time, we can’t (legally) get paid by multiple funding bodies for the same work, so we need to ensure that projects don’t overlap.</p>\n<p>We applied for this and the NGI TRUST grant concurrently, but we didn’t expect to win both.\nNLnet’s deadlines are considerably less strict, however, so we’ve prioritized SMC and saved <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dialogue</a> for the coming year.\nAll <em>NGI0 PET</em> projects have to be completed by late 2021, so we expect this to be our last.</p>\n<p>CryptPad is currently specialized mostly for real-time document editing, and our cryptographic permissions system reflects that.\nThe main idea behind this project is to develop a new set of applications with different permission schemes that support more granular permissions for document components instead of all-or-nothing permissions for whole documents.</p>\n<p>We already offer a <em>poll</em> application, but it uses the same <em>editor/viewer</em> roles as our document editors, which really doesn’t match users’ expectations.\nThis current implementation will be phased out in favour of the new scheme to support distinct roles for authors (who can ask questions and determine who can answer them), responders (who can submit answers), and viewers (who can see responses).\nWe’re also going to add support for more complex surveys with multiple questions, implement a reminder system to notify authors and viewers when their polls have closed, and add some more instance admin functionality so that we and other people hosting CryptPad can communicate with their users via the existing notification system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"MOSS\"><a href=\"#MOSS\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"MOSS\"></a>MOSS</h3><p>The requirements of <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mozilla’s Open-Source Support</a> program were considerably less formal than those of NLnet and NGI TRUST.\nWe received 10000 USD, which converted to about 9000 Euros at the time we received it, and we promised to use it to improve page loading times.\nThere wasn’t any contract or formal definition of how we’d planned to do this, and no deadline given.</p>\n<p>This funding model was extremely helpful for us this year and did a fantastic job of living up to its name and goal of supporting open-source.\nOur European funding partners provide all or most of their financial support as their deliverables or the entire project are completed.\nBy contrast, MOSS solved some immediate cash-flow issues during this difficult year and afforded us the flexibility to fulfill our promises in between our other deadlines.</p>\n<p>So far we’ve followed up on these goals by profiling page loading times on different devices to determine where to best spend our efforts.\nWe’ve made a number of small optimizations on the client along with some big server improvements that were frequently the cause of bottlenecks when establishing a new connection to the server.\nThere’s still much more to do in this regard, and we plan to post ongoing updates as we find more room for improvement.</p>\n<h2 id=\"A-year-of-surprises\"><a href=\"#A-year-of-surprises\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"A year of surprises\"></a>A year of surprises</h2><p>With the exception of our MOSS grant, everything I’ve mentioned so far was planned and proposed late in 2019.\nWe’d set our objectives for 2020 early on and had carefully considered how we could coordinate our multiple projects and how their features could complement each other.\nAs you might imagine, very little went according to plan.</p>\n<p>i vaguely recall a few headlines about a respiratory illness being discovered in China late last year, but I didn’t give it much thought and obviously didn’t foresee the impact it would have on our plans for the year, let alone everything else it affected.\nAs the epidemic became more widespread, was upgraded to pandemic status, and triggered lockdowns across the world increasingly more people moved to working online.\nPreviously, I was happy with our success when we saw ten to fifteen thousand users in a week, but those numbers quickly doubled, tripled, and quadrupled in a matter of months as offices and classrooms started relying heavily on our platform.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/2020-users.png\" alt=\"Unique IPs per visiting CryptPad.fr per day\"></p>\n<p>We made some significant changes to our server code to keep up with demand and eliminated some of our client’s code that was particularly expensive for the server.\nThe precise technical details of exactly what we did to adapt to the dramatic increase in usage deserve their own article, but in general we suddenly had to pay a lot more attention to our infrastructure than was previously the case.\nWe started regularly allocating more disk space to the server and, as 2020 ends, we now store more than six times more user data than we did this time last year.</p>\n<p>One major lesson we’ve learned, however, is that it’s been far easier to scale our infrastructure than manual support for the platform.\nOur surge of new users came along with a matching increase in support tickets, emails, GitHub iissues, and questions on social media.\nWe prioritized the documentation that we were writing as a part of our <em>Communities</em> project, however, we still had to take time to answer the questions of people who hadn’t found those docs or whose questions were not clearly answered therein.</p>\n<p>We’re still working to streamline this process, but our ability to respond to individual questions is a frequent bottleneck for our team.\nThis typically makes it more difficult to stay on top of our usual development cycle, and leaves less time than we’d like for promoting the project via public events or blog articles.\nHaving too many users is a fantastic problem to have, though, so this is less a complaint and more an acknowledgement of a challenge that we need to address.\nWe can’t afford to be just <em>a team of

Whether you prefer to read, watch or listen there is a way for you to get an up-to-date presentation of CryptPad.\n\nAaron MacSween was invited for an [Ask Me Anything (AMA) thread on r/privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/k1uonq/im_aaron_macsween_project_lead_for_cryptpad_the/) on Reddit. The thread started on November 27th 2020 and lasted for a couple of days. 98 questions were raised about everything from CryptPad's business model, to future development plans, the broader state of open-source software, and the EU's recent debates against encryption.\n\nAaron was also a guest on the [We Don't Stream podcast](https://www.jamesmullarkey.com/2020/11/imagine-google-docs-but-without-the-spyware-with-aaron-macsween/) in an episode titled *Imagine Google Docs but without the spyware*.

MacSween","_content":"\nFor anyone that doesn't have the time or interest to read the rest of this article, the short version is that the CryptPad team has received a 50000 Euro grant from [NLnet foundation](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/). This funding will be directed towards the design and development of _team-centric_ features in a project we're calling _CryptPad Teams_.\n\nIf you're still reading, I assume you want to know more about our plans and our relationship with NLnet.\n\n## Some backstory...\n\nUp until the end of March 2019 our team's work was funded by the [OpenPaaS project](https://open-paas.org/), a four-year French research project in which CryptPad was only a minor component.\nOur role was to produce a set of collaborative editors for the open-source platform.\nIt was never stated that our contributions should be delivered as a standalone platform, but having a self-contained code-base that we could easily update and deploy simplified our job.\n\nCryptPad had already been prototyped as a part of a previous research project, though its scope was considerably smaller than what would be required by OpenPaaS.\nSince the platform was being developed with businesses and other large institutions in mind, confidentiality was a concern and a stated requirement of the project.\nEven so, I think it's fair to say nobody expected us to make privacy such an central part of our design.\n\nIn many organizations these design choices might have been seen as digressions.\nWe've been fortunate to have had a lot of support from our employer, ([XWiki SAS](https://www.xwiki.com/)).\nConsequently, we were able to nurture a prototype such that it grew into a platform, a product, and a community.\nStill we knew all along that our role in the OpenPaaS project would come to an end, and that without external funding it would be difficult to continue with the momentum we'd established.\n\n## Support from our community\n\nAs an active member of the community concerned about privacy issues, I know there are a lot of people that are suspicious of government money.\nWhile I understand that this distrust is justified by a lot of history, I'm very satisfied with what I consider _the European software model_ of funding work public work with public money, keeping in mind that I'm a Canadian that's lived in France for the past few years.\n\nWithout the social investment we've received so far it would have been very difficult to create a product of sufficient quality that anyone would pay for it.\nI often hear people rebutt this point by saying that a lot of _free-software_ is produced _for free_ by volunteers.\nPersonally I'm in the camp that believes that the people writing that software deserve the same financial stability that is enjoyed by those producing software with proprietary or extractive business models, but that's a bit beyond the scope of this article.\n\nIn any case, before going on to talk about the very generous contribution we've received, I wanted to acknowledge the support up until now from individuals and organizations that use CryptPad.\nSince the end of our last project and the beginning of this new one, we've been sustained by a mix of the revenue generated by [subscriptions to CryptPad.fr](https://accounts.cryptpad.fr/#/?on=cryptpad.fr) and [donations to our OpenCollective campaign](https://opencollective.com/cryptpad).\nThese contributions help to keep CryptPad going in such brief periods when we haven't secured larger sources of funding as well as providing alternatives should such opportunities cease to be available.\n\nYou can expect another post in the near future about the status of our crowdfunding campaign where we'll go over our crowdfunding campaign in more depth.\n\n## NLnet and the _Next Generation Internet_\n\nYou might recall that we recently [visited Barcelona](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/02/22/Heading-to-Barcelona/) to receive an _NGI award_ for _privacy and trust-enhanced technologies_.\nThose awards were organized as a part of the [NGI initiative](https://www.ngi.eu/), funded by the European Union's [Horizon 2020 research program](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en).\n\nAs a part of the initiative, NLnet has been made responsible for distributing a rather large sum of money to smaller projects through the administration of [Search and Discovery](https://nlnet.nl/discovery/) and [Privacy (and trust) Enhancing Technologies](https://nlnet.nl/PET/).\nBy delegating these enormous tasks to NLnet the EU has recognized their excellent track record for supporting projects that actively contribute towards an open information society.\n\nNaturally we're very happy to receive the financial support, but beyond that the foundation has offered a variety of other resources which they have at their disposal by way of having played a strong role in the European free software community.\nThey've offered expertise in accessibility, documentation, security auditing, internationalization, and legal matters surrounding software licensing, among other things.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that for all of this support that we'll receive, the amount of time we've spent writing the initial proposal and following up until the point of signing a contract has been remarkably brief.\nWhether considering the delay between submission and acceptance or the actual time spent on documents and correspondence, they've kept the bureaucracy to an absolute minimum.\nFor a small team like ours, this makes a massive difference in our ability to access such funding and to put more of our time towards the activities the money is meant to support.\n\n## What _CryptPad Teams_ will entail\n\nThis purpose of this grant is to develop technologies which enhance the public's ability to preserve their privacy.\nOur contract defines the milestones which we must reach in order to get paid.\nI voluntarily included a stipulation that we would not consider a goal complete until its components were publicly accessible as source code and in our hosted platform.\nThis was meant to ensure that the outcomes benefit our community of users and developers alike.\n\nStarting with CryptPad 2.23.0 we'll introduce support for personal encrypted mailboxes for registered users.\nWe're not looking to replace e-mail or the other platforms which are focused on encrypted messaging, this will just be a simple feature which will allow users to interact with each other more effectively whether or not they are online at the same time.\n\nOur first use-case for this is an improved version of our \"friend request\" which currently requires that both users be online.\nYou'll be able to send friend requests from user's profile pages and they'll see a notification the next time they visit CryptPad.\nGoing forward we'll use the same system to offer friends access to documents directly through the sharing menu, instead of having to send URLs over potentially insecure mediums like unencrypted email or messengers.\nSimilarly, friends will be able to request the ability to edit documents that they can view, as well as to request \"ownership\" over documents which they should be able to delete.\n\nAs minor as some of this functionality might sound, we believe they'll make a positive and significant impact on users' privacy.\nWe want to minimize how often they have to directly handle the encryption keys which protect the contents of their documents.\n\nAfter these initial steps we'll begin offering first-class support for teams within CryptPad, allowing users to define groups of friends so that they can delegate access quickly and effectively.\nTeams will integrate with shared folders and will eventually offer features targeting various types of groups, whether hierarchical as is customary in many businesses or on a more ad-hoc basis as might be expected with friends or other self-organizing groups.\nTeam members will benefit from better oversight as to who can access particular documents, reducing the likelihood that they'll accidentally leak private information.\nWe want to offer users better oversight into the activity of documents in their CryptDrives, both to make it easier to quickly join editing sessions with friends, as well as to make it noticeable when access to a document has leaked outside of its intended audience.\n\n## The hard part\n\nDifferent groups have different levels of trust among their members.\nIt's difficult to build these features in a manner that's fast to use with friends while still preventing your boss from spying on you.\nWe're committed to thinking through all of these cases to keep our users safe, and to acting on users concerns if we don't get it right the first time.\n\nWe're excited to begin this project and grateful to everyone supporting our efforts, financially or otherwise.\n_Teams_ is the first grant we've received _explicitly_ for the development of CryptPad, and we couldn't have gotten here without help.\nAs always, if you have ideas, concerns, or questions feel free to [contact

href=\"#NLnet-and-the-Next-Generation-Internet\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"NLnet and the Next Generation Internet\"></a>NLnet and the <em>Next Generation Internet</em></h2><p>You might recall that we recently <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2019/02/22/Heading-to-Barcelona/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">visited Barcelona</a> to receive an <em>NGI award</em> for <em>privacy and trust-enhanced technologies</em>.\nThose awards were organized as a part of the <a href=\"https://www.ngi.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NGI initiative</a>, funded by the European Union’s <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Horizon 2020 research program</a>.</p>\n<p>As a part of the initiative, NLnet has been made responsible for distributing a rather large sum of money to smaller projects through the administration of <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/discovery/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Search and Discovery</a> and <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/PET/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Privacy (and trust) Enhancing Technologies</a>.\nBy delegating these enormous tasks to NLnet the EU has recognized their excellent track record for supporting projects that actively contribute towards an open information society.</p>\n<p>Naturally we’re very happy to receive the financial support, but beyond that the foundation has offered a variety of other resources which they have at their disposal by way of having played a strong role in the European free software community.\nThey’ve offered expertise in accessibility, documentation, security auditing, internationalization, and legal matters surrounding software licensing, among other things.</p>\n<p>Finally, it’s worth mentioning that for all of this support that we’ll receive, the amount of time we’ve spent writing the initial proposal and following up until the point of signing a contract has been remarkably brief.\nWhether considering the delay between submission and acceptance or the actual time spent on documents and correspondence, they’ve kept the bureaucracy to an absolute minimum.\nFor a small team like ours, this makes a massive difference in our ability to access such funding and to put more of our time towards the activities the money is meant to support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-CryptPad-Teams-will-entail\"><a href=\"#What-CryptPad-Teams-will-entail\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What CryptPad Teams will entail\"></a>What <em>CryptPad Teams</em> will entail</h2><p>This purpose of this grant is to develop technologies which enhance the public’s ability to preserve their privacy.\nOur contract defines the milestones which we must reach in order to get paid.\nI voluntarily included a stipulation that we would not consider a goal complete until its components were publicly accessible as source code and in our hosted platform.\nThis was meant to ensure that the outcomes benefit our community of users and developers alike.</p>\n<p>Starting with CryptPad 2.23.0 we’ll introduce support for personal encrypted mailboxes for registered users.\nWe’re not looking to replace e-mail or the other platforms which are focused on encrypted messaging, this will just be a simple feature which will allow users to interact with each other more effectively whether or not they are online at the same time.</p>\n<p>Our first use-case for this is an improved version of our “friend request” which currently requires that both users be online.\nYou’ll be able to send friend requests from user’s profile pages and they’ll see a notification the next time they visit CryptPad.\nGoing forward we’ll use the same system to offer friends access to documents directly through the sharing menu, instead of having to send URLs over potentially insecure mediums like unencrypted email or messengers.\nSimilarly, friends will be able to request the ability to edit documents that they can view, as well as to request “ownership” over documents which they should be able to delete.</p>\n<p>As minor as some of this functionality might sound, we believe they’ll make a positive and significant impact on users’ privacy.\nWe want to minimize how often they have to directly handle the encryption keys which protect the contents of their documents.</p>\n<p>After these initial steps we’ll begin offering first-class support for teams within CryptPad, allowing users to define groups of friends so that they can delegate access quickly and effectively.\nTeams will integrate with shared folders and will eventually offer features targeting various types of groups, whether hierarchical as is customary in many businesses or on a more ad-hoc basis as might be expected with friends or other self-organizing groups.\nTeam members will benefit from better oversight as to who can access particular documents, reducing the likelihood that they’ll accidentally leak private information.\nWe want to offer users better oversight into the activity of documents in their CryptDrives, both to make it easier to quickly join editing sessions with friends, as well as to make it noticeable when access to a document has leaked outside of its intended audience.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-hard-part\"><a href=\"#The-hard-part\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The hard part\"></a>The hard part</h2><p>Different groups have different levels of trust among their members.\nIt’s difficult to build these features in a manner that’s fast to use with friends while still preventing your boss from spying on you.\nWe’re committed to thinking through all of these cases to keep our users safe, and to acting on users concerns if we don’t get it right the first time.</p>\n<p>We’re excited to begin this project and grateful to everyone supporting our efforts, financially or otherwise.\n<em>Teams</em> is the first grant we’ve received <em>explicitly</em> for the development of CryptPad, and we couldn’t have gotten here without help.\nAs always, if you have ideas, concerns, or questions feel free to <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/contact.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact us</a>.</p>\n"},{"title":"Time to Encrypt the Cloud","date":"2017-02-20T12:24:02.000Z","author":"Caleb James DeLisle","_content":"\nFrom typing a business letter to taking pictures with friends, the internet has changed every part of our lives.\nWe don't just share information with people, we also want it synced across our computers, tablets, and phones.\n\nModern technology allows us to do this, but it does so by sending all our data to _the Cloud_.\n\nA lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.\n\n## There is little that one person can do\n\nTerms of service are long, vague documents which usually don't address knowledge _derived_ from your data.\nMore sinister: you can never really know if they're cheating.\nAd networks don't tell you how they know or even what they know.\nThey just show you ads, based on what they discovered about you... _somehow_.\n\n## What's your personal information worth?\n\n* Normally  $0.0005 - $0.0021 per person\n* Pregnant in your second trimester? $0.11 (_52 times as much_)\n* Have a specific health condition? $0.26 (_123 times as much_)\n\nThis is only going to get worse.\nArtificial Intelligence technology is maturing and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from _us_, its most valuable products.\n\nThe result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don't need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.\n\n>  _All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public._\n>\n> --Quinn Norton\n\nWhile we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies which don't _extract maximum value_ from our data will eventually be acquired by those which do.\n\n## Zero Knowledge\n\nFortunately we don't have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can make information available across your devices without being able to read the data which it stores.\n\nWe do this by adding a hash character (#) to a link.\nBy design, browsers don't share anything after this character.\nThat means we can share encryption keys just by sharing links.\nFurthermore, a username and password can be made into a secret key which allows a person's private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.\n\n## How do we know you're secure?\n\nZero Knowledge web apps are not intended to _make you secure_, they're intended to be _provably ethical_.\nThis cannot be overstated, for too long we have been forced to choose between \"James Bond\" security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize your data.\n\n> _Our promise to you is that our business model is not to spy on you, and it never will be_.\n\nWe hope that the security community will join us in building user-friendly, Zero Knowledge services.\nPrivacy is a social problem as much as it is a mathematical one, and it is time we take that seriously.\n\n## What we're going to do\n\nWe are going to show the world that web apps can be elegant and usable while still respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we've never collected any data but we can prove we're not doing it systematically.\n\nTo start off this conversation, we have developed [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr), the first ever Zero Knowledge Realtime Collaborative Editor.\nWe are aiming to make it the most user friendly, most productive collaboration tool available, and still Zero Knowledge.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to make the CryptPad project [Open Source](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).\nWe did this not only because Open Source is in our culture, but also because we want Zero Knowledge web apps to become the universal standard.\n\n### The plan in four steps\n\n1. Develop the most user friendly collaboration tool available which is also Zero Knowledge.\n2. Use this tool to explain the problem and show that an alternative is possible.\n3. Open Source the work we do so that others can also build Zero Knowledge apps.\n4. Foster a culture where privacy by default is a baseline expectation.\n\n## How you can help\n\n* Use CryptPad and other Zero Knowledge services evey day, tell us what you like and what we can do better.\n* Show your support: Buy an upgraded account (_coming soon_) from us, the people who are developing the code.\n* If you install the Open Source code of CryptPad on your own servers, consider buying a support contract.\n* Talk to your friends and colleagues about Zero Knowledge, show them CryptPad and explain that this is what the cloud can be.\n* If you're a web developer, think about Zero Knowledge for your next web app.\n\n## Other Zero Knowledge Services\n\n### Open Source\n\n* Sync backups to Google or Dropbox and force them to become Zero Knowledge\n  * https://cryptomator.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator\n* Easy chrome extension for gmail users to send & receive end-to-end encrypted email\n  * https://cryptup.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/tomholub/cryptup-chrome\n* Send and receive end-to-end encrypted email using your normal email account (Mobile, Desktop version coming soon)\n  * https://prettyeasyprivacy.com/\n  * https://cacert.pep.foundation/trac\n* Send end-to-end encrypted text messages on a phone or computer\n  * https://wire.com/en/\n  * https://github.com/wireapp/\n* Send end-to-end encrypted text messages on your phone\n  * https://whispersystems.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/whispersystems\n* Type or paste a message and give the link to friends\n  * https://ncry.pt/  (Source code: https://github.com/luggs-co/ncrypt)\n  * https://privatebin.net/ (Source code: https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin)\n* Chat online with lots of people at once\n  * https://riot.im/  **NOTE:** End-to-end encryption mode in beta so currently disabled by default\n  * Source code: https://github.com/vector-im\n\n### Proprietary\n\nWhile we value Open Source, the need for Zero Knowledge Cloud is paramount and we respect the\ndecision of some organizations to keep parts of their codebases proprietary.\n\n* Data backup\n  * https://www.boxcryptor.com/en\n  * https://whisp.ly/en\n  * https://www.sync.com/\n  * https://www.pcloud.com\n  * https://spideroak.com/personal/spideroak-one\n* Chat and instant messaging\n  * https://spideroak.com/personal/semaphor\n* Send and receive end-to-end encrypted email\n  * https://protonmail.com/\n* Web of trust and proof of identity\n  * https://keybase.io/\n\n\nAn important one which we forgot?

just share information with people, we also want it synced across our computers, tablets, and phones.</p>\n<p>Modern technology allows us to do this, but it does so by sending all our data to <em>the Cloud</em>.</p>\n<p>A lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\"><a href=\"#There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"There is little

a specific health condition? $0.26 (<em>123 times as much</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is only going to get worse.\nArtificial Intelligence technology is maturing and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from _us_, its most valuable products.</p>\n<p>The result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don’t need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> <em>All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public.</em></p>\n<p>–Quinn Norton</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies which don’t <em>extract maximum value</em> from our data will eventually be acquired by those which do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Zero-Knowledge\"><a href=\"#Zero-Knowledge\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Zero Knowledge\"></a>Zero Knowledge</h2><p>Fortunately we don’t have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can make information available across your devices without being able to read the data which it stores.</p>\n<p>We do this by adding a hash character (#) to a link.\nBy design, browsers don’t share anything after this character.\nThat means we can share encryption keys just by sharing links.\nFurthermore, a username and password can be made into a secret key which allows a person’s private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\"><a href=\"#How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do we know you’re secure?\"></a>How do we know

forced to choose between “James Bond” security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize your data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Our promise to you is that our business model is not to spy on you, and it never will be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We hope that the security community will join us in building user-friendly, Zero Knowledge services.\nPrivacy is a social

about our intention to follow a [biweekly release schedule](/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/).\nSince then, we've thought of every second Tuesday as _release day_.\nStarting with [the letter A](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.0.0) on February 21st, 2017 and ending with [the letter Z](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.25.0) on January 30th, 2018, we went through the whole latin alphabet.\n\nThroughout this self-imposed regimen, we managed to meet each deadline, though on occasion we had to stay at the office later than usual.\nAny time a release was more difficult than expected, we considered what went wrong and added a counter-measure to our release checklist (in CryptPad, naturally).\nEach release became easier than the one before, but even so, we found there were some drawbacks to this rigid schedule.\n\n## Changing our pace\n\nHaving a regular rhythm for our releases trained us to break up complex features into components that could be implemented within a two week period.\nWith that in mind, not all tasks fit neatly within two weeks, and those larger tasks have had a tendency to get pushed to the next release.\nSo, now that we've finished one full year of releases, we've started to look more closely at those larger features which we've inadvertently neglected.\nThe tendency to procrastinate on especially difficult features is just another challenge to approach, but it's been one which is somewhat more difficult to summarize within a _to do_ list.\n\nAs of CryptPad v1.26.0, we're no longer following the strict biweekly schedule.\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean we're slowing down development.\nWe're still _working on CryptPad consistently_.\nWe still plan to _deliver features to users_ as soon as they are stable.\nWe still plan to _deploy on Tuesdays_, since it's as early in the week as possible without falling on a Monday and deploying on a Friday is a _terrible idea_.\n\n<img src=\"/images/iamdevloper_deploy_on_friday.jpeg\" alt=\"Should I release on a Friday?\" style=\"width:50%;\" />\n\nSome releases might happen in a single week.\nOthers might take stretch to three weeks or a full month, but we'll do our best not to take any longer than that.\nWe try to be as transparent as possible with our plans, and so users should expect each release to also specify the projected date for the following release.\n\n## What's coming next...\n\nIn the last year, we tried to find a balance between improving user security through the use of our [sandboxing techniques](2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/), and implementing the productivity features necessary for people to consider the security improvements an _added bonus_ rather than an impractical ideology.\nThe core of our philosophy is that _security_ and _ease of use_ must be packaged together in order for tools like CryptPad to benefit users.\n\nWhile CryptPad is considerably more than a _proof-of-concept_, we don't consider it anywhere close to being finished.\nAs heavy users of CryptPad ourselves, we are aware of its rough edges.\nOur community has been very supportive with our continued development, though, so we're excited to be able to improve the following areas!\n\n### Sharing\n\nWe spend a lot of time passing links between each other when collaborating on a project.\nIn order to do so _privately_, the sender and the receiver must both use an encrypted messenger, or else the message could be intercepted by a malicious third-party.\nThe necessity of having to use a second tool makes it so that CryptPad must always be used as _part of the solution_, rather than solving a user's problem outright.\n\nWe'd like to approach this problem with two improvements:\n\n1. integrate our existing encrypted messenger better with the rest of CryptPad's functionality (as per [this issue](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/79))\n2. develop a method of sharing entire folder structures from a users drive, so that sharing can scale to support large-scale projects, a feature we call _Workgroups_\n\n### Layered protection\n\nEven if the link for a pad is shared securely, there is the possibility that somebody discovers that link through other (possibly malicious) means.\nWe're interested in developing CryptPad's basic two-tier permission system (edit/view) to address such concerns.\nThis could be accomplished in very different ways:\n\n* add the ability to protect a pad with a password, so that anyone who finds the link must also know a secret value in order to retrieve the pad's history from the server\n* add the ability to encrypt messages such that only a designated set of users can decrypt them using public-key cryptography\n\nSo far CryptPad only features a very limited set of cryptographic techniques.\nGoing forward, we hope to find ways to implement a more granular permission system which does not rely on the server behaving correctly.\nSome of these features are more in the realm of _applied-cryptography research_ than _web application development_, so it's very likely they'll be implemented later, but we're excited about them nevertheless.\n\n### Increased trustworthiness\n\nEven though CryptPad performs its encryption in your browser, there is always the possibility that a compromised server could send malicious code to the browser which would cause it to reveal its secrets.\nWe're interested in developing features which would mitigate these kinds of attacks against users, through a combination of modern browser features like [sub-resource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity), and perhaps a registry of verified code signatures signed by us, the developers.\n\nIt's very difficult to make a web application secure against those responsible for delivering its source to your browser.\nWe're actively searching for any kind of technique for securing that makes CryptPad a more robust platform for storing your data privately, even against ourselves.\n\n### Password usability\n\nCryptPad's login system looks quite conventional at first glance, since it has a field for a _user-name_ and _password_ like most other web applications.\nUnlike those other applications, we never learn your user-name and password.\nInstead, your browser uses those fields to generate a unique secret value which you use to encrypt your drive, and accomplish a range of other tasks.\nThe downside of this approach is that if a user forgets their username or password, we can't help them gain access to their documents.\nIf we could, we'd be able to access their documents ourselves.\n\nFortunately, we're not the only team building web applications that use cryptography, and so there has been some research into how to improve password-based workflows without revealing secrets data to the server's host (us).\nWe've already received emails from users who've inadvertently locked themselves out of their accounts with no way to recover their data, and that's a situation we'd like to help people avoid, so this is a feature we're looking forward to offering.\n\n### More applications\n\nLots of users have requested that we add a few more applications to CryptPad, and we've been listening!\nWe plan to add support for spreadsheets, and possibly other applications so that people don't have to fall back to using an unencrypted CryptPad alternative.\n\n### Scalability\n\nOne advantage CryptPad has over other conventional collaboration platforms is that a lot of the difficult computation is run in the users' browsers, rather than on our server.\nThis means that we can support a very large number of clients without a noticeable decrease in performance.\nEven so, the number of people using _CryptPad.fr_ and the amount they use it has increased dramatically.\n\nThough excessive popularity is a wonderful problem to have, we'd like to avoid a situation where users have difficulty accessing our service, so improved scalability is something we'd like to work on.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe haven't yet decided how long we intend for this release cycle to last, and we don't have a set list of the exact goals we'd like to accomplish.\nWe're taking a step back to decide where we'd like to go next.\n\nWe recognize that CryptPad's growth over the last year was driven largely by word of mouth between friends and colleagues who care about privacy.\nBy moving towards a more flexible schedule, we hope to make it easier to adapt to the frequent feedback we receive from people using CryptPad to help them accomplish a multitude of goals.\n\nWe're very interested in hearing what you think about this change.\nFeel free to reach out to us through any of the methods listed on [our contact page](https://cryptpad.fr/contact.html).\n","source":"_posts/One-year-of-biweekly-releases.md","raw":"---\ntitle: One year of biweekly releases\ndate: 2018-02-23 14:37:15\nauthor: Aaron

so <em>privately</em>, the sender and the receiver must both use an encrypted messenger, or else the message could be intercepted by a malicious third-party.\nThe necessity of having to use a second tool makes it so that CryptPad must always be used as <em>part of the solution</em>, rather than solving a user’s problem outright.</p>\n<p>We’d like to approach this problem with two improvements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>integrate our existing encrypted messenger better with the rest of CryptPad’s functionality (as per <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this issue</a>)</li>\n<li>develop a method of sharing entire folder structures from a users drive, so that sharing can scale to support large-scale projects, a

the link for a pad is shared securely, there is the possibility that somebody discovers that link through other (possibly malicious) means.\nWe’re interested in developing CryptPad’s basic two-tier permission system (edit/view) to address such concerns.\nThis could be accomplished in very different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add the ability to protect a pad with a password, so that anyone who finds the link must also know a secret value in order to retrieve the pad’s history from the server</li>\n<li>add the ability to encrypt messages such that only a designated set of users can decrypt them

system which does not rely on the server behaving correctly.\nSome of these features are more in the realm of <em>applied-cryptography research</em> than <em>web application development</em>, so it’s

title=\"Increased trustworthiness\"></a>Increased trustworthiness</h3><p>Even though CryptPad performs its encryption in your browser, there is always the possibility that a compromised server could

of modern browser features like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sub-resource integrity</a>, and perhaps a

id=\"Password-usability\"><a href=\"#Password-usability\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Password usability\"></a>Password usability</h3><p>CryptPad’s login system looks quite conventional at first glance, since it has a field for a <em>user-name</em> and <em>password</em> like most other web applications.\nUnlike those other applications, we never learn your user-name and password.\nInstead, your browser uses those fields to generate a unique secret value which you use to encrypt your drive, and accomplish a range of other tasks.\nThe downside of this approach is that if a user forgets their username or password, we can’t help them gain access to their documents.\nIf we could, we’d be able to access their documents ourselves.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we’re not the only team building web applications that use cryptography, and so there has been some research into how to improve password-based workflows without revealing secrets data to the server’s host (us).\nWe’ve already received emails from users who’ve inadvertently locked themselves out of their accounts with no way to recover their data, and that’s a situation we’d like to help people avoid, so this is a feature we’re looking forward to offering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"More-applications\"><a href=\"#More-applications\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"More applications\"></a>More applications</h3><p>Lots of users have requested that we add a few more applications to CryptPad, and we’ve been listening!\nWe plan to add support for spreadsheets, and possibly other applications so that people don’t have to fall back to using an

conventional collaboration platforms is that a lot of the difficult computation is run in the users’ browsers, rather than on our server.\nThis means that we can support a very large number of clients

DeLisle","_content":"\nWe have gotten a lot of questions about the concept of Zero Knowledge, the vision and ethics as well as the exact meaning.\n\n* What is Zero Knowledge?\n* How can encryption in the browser be secure?\n* What about metadata?\n* Most importantly: How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge?\n\nI wanted to write a blog post to clarify what Zero Knowledge is all about. Zero Knowledge has two meanings, it can refer to a *Zero Knowledge Proof*, an obscure mathematical construct with few real-world uses but it can also refer to something with a very real-world meaning: web services which encrypt your content so that they themselves cannot read it. You may be wondering how this can be secure when a web administrator can quietly change their site to an unencrypted version at any time. This is a real problem, there is currently no way to verify the content (and code) of a website, but we need not despair. Even though we cannot prove that a website is *secure*, we can check that they are promising to make themselves blind to your content and they make that promise knowing if break it they might get caught.\n\n## Security is probabilistic\n\nConsider the security software you use every day such as your web browser with HTTPS, your phone and your computer's operating system. Have you ever stopped to check that software for \"backdoors\" (intentionally inserted which break your security)? If you have then you are one of the tiny group of heroes who dedicate their time to making the world a bit more robust and I salute you for it. If you're like the rest of us, you just hope that the authors of that software were honest enough and protective enough of their reputations to avoid inserting a backdoor when it means potentially getting caught. Zero Knowledge is based on the same logic, just as software makers can surreptitiously add a backdoor to their software, Zero Knowledge websites can serve a backdoor to the user. However, just as software makers who insert backdoors in their software risk getting caught, Zero Knowledge web app providers who insert backdoors in their website also risk being caught.\n\n## The metadata question\n\nMetadata is a serious issue. Former CIA director Michael Hayden said of the agency: \"We kill people based on metadata\". I don't want to belittle the importance of data which is not the actual content, but at the same time we must recognize that there is a huge uphill climb fix this issue. While the CryptPad project tries not to collect metadata when it can be avoided, we also recognize that other cloud providers may collect more or less metadata than us in order to provide their services. Fundamentally, we accept that a service qualifies as Zero Knowledge as long as the *content* is protected from the server operators. We are committed to studying ways to develop new, more secure solutions to the metadata issue but the spirit of Zero Knowledge is about more ethical solutions which are immediately actionable.\n\n## How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge\n\nZero Knowledge is about trust, nobody can read over and verify all of the code of all of the Zero Knowledge services available, but there are some heuristics which you can use when choosing a service.\n\n### 1. Is it primarily Open Source ?\n\nServices which are primarily Open Source are easier to evaluate both for accidental security mistakes and for potentially nefarious behavior. Furthermore, when a company commits their software to Open Source they make a statement that they are in the business of being an ethical provider for the long term and are not just riding the wave of a popular term.\n\n### 2. Were you warned about losing your password ?\n\nTrue Zero Knowledge services must protect your data from themselves using something you know and they don't, such as your password... In the event that you lose your password and you are using a true Zero Knowledge service, your content will be inaccessible to you and to the service - the locks that keep them out will keep you out as well. Check for this warning.\n\n### 3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?\n\nThis is perhaps the most important question, because when a service provider makes the public statement that they are Zero Knowledge, they show they are prepared to risk their reputation if they are discovered to be storing your content in a way they can access. Some Zero Knowledge providers prefer the term *End-to-end Encrypted* which has gained significant popularity with messaging apps. There is no functional difference between a Zero Knowledge application and one which advertizes End-to-end Encryption.\n\n## Talk to us\n\nCryptPad is developed by a team of 3 people with generous financing from BPIFrance through the [OpenPaaS::NG Research Project](http://ng.open-paas.org/about-us.html). Our mission is to make Cloud Computing more ethical by promoting Zero Knowledge Cloud Services and show young entrepreneurs that it is possible to make a living while being ethical with peoples' data.

In order to do this, we made use of the web-app model so people could just go to cryptpad.fr and immediately begin using the app, no installation necessary. However, this model has a known flaw, the server can decide what client-side code it will send to any given user, allowing a compromized server to serve code with a back-door vulnerability.\n\nRecently, I did an experiment to make CryptPad more secure against these types of attacks by signing the code. CryptPad is a unique webapp, even without considering the encryption aspect. There is no build system, the code we write is exactly the same as what your web browser runs. All of the CryptPad html, javascript and resources are static files which are served by a plain old web server. The data persistance is managed by an API server which the web browser communicates with using an HTML5 WebSocket. Finally, in order to add a layer of security against possible Cross Site Scripting attacks, CryptPad makes use of a [cross domain iframe](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/), protecting your encryption keys from the majority of the CryptPad code in the same way that your online bank is protected from that sketchy porn site open in another tab.\n\nSince CryptPad has no build system, there are many small javascript files which must be loaded. To do this, CryptPad uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). While many small files are generally considered to be bad for website performance, RequireJS uses the HTML5 [async attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) to tell the browser not to block loading of other things while waiting for the scripts to load. Secondly, RequireJS also allows version numbers to be added to the script URLs which allows us to cache almost everything in the browser. Finally, we use the [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) protocol to serve resources because it allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time, while HTTP/2 is incompatible with WebSocket, this is ok because the web-app is served from a different server from the API server.\n\n## Chain of Trust\n\nJust one corrupted script is enough to render the security of an entire web-app useless, so in CryptPad we needed the signing to cover all javascript files. Fortunately there is a new HTML5 technology called [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) which allows putting the hash of a script in a script tag attribute and makes the browser verify the script before executing it.\n\nInsecure, some.website can serve you anything:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSecure, only one possible script can be sent by some.website or else the web browser will throw an error and refuse to run the script:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-G1KwaJYUEDsA1SD/6Wt4z0laskKzIwgqgs5cYH0CW/o=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSo rather than signing every script, I only needed to make a list of hashes of every script, and sign that. What I needed was a way to generate a *manifest*, and so I developed a small program which could hash all of the javascript files in CryptPad and generate a manifest file. The content of the manifest looks something like this:\n\n```\n\"files\": {\n  \"assert\": {\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"frame.js\": \"BrN2JNnK4QJCztw3PyRRPAsEwSq5lczTBrRkzdLAFow=\",\n      \"respond.js\": \"yO0KFMHiCdE1fXFWPVaFB+Mmh37OCl/UNPpXrYtWF7A=\"\n    },\n    \"main.js\": \"ABf3uhmYVHWaHX6vhK8K2jAUY8XqRjjMJ2FqXVGLZE0=\",\n    \"translations\": {\n      \"main.js\": \"50Ami2eghyXcGKGYTaDK1vUeEuAEG7kcpvUoCKbUaUU=\"\n```\n\nIt contains a JSON tree which mirrors the files that are part of the CryptPad codebase and the hashes of the files for the Subresource Integrity check. Once the `manifest.js` file was created, then I needed a javascript file which would load and verify it. Since the manifest is different every time a new release is made, the verification of the manifest needed to be via *signing*. The manifest hash was signed along with a version number and those were placed in a file called `version.txt` and `version.txt` is loaded using a file called `sboot.js`. The hash of `sboot.js` was included directly into the html files which are cached, so `sboot.js` can never be changed at all.\n\n## Loading process\n\n### index.html\nFirst, the browser loads the html file, the html file contains a single script tag loading `sboot.js`\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  data-bootload=\"/customize/template.js\"\n  src=\"/common/sboot.js?ver=8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk%2B%2BVQ%2BBk83mRdXx4dK%2BXvSNPcI%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk++VQ+Bk83mRdXx4dK+XvSNPcI=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nThere is a custom attribute called `data-bootload` which indicates which javascript file should be loaded for that `html` file.\n\n### sboot.js\n\nWhen `sboot.js` gets loaded, it downloads and then verifies `version.txt` which is a signed message containing the CryptPad version number and the hash of `manifest.js`. The content that is signed looks something like this:\n\n```\n[85,\"h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"]\n```\n\nThe version number (85) is not the CryptPad version but rather an auto-incrementing number which is stored in the browser localStorage and prevents the server from downgrading the version of CryptPad. After the signature/version check completes successfully, `sboot.js` loads `manifest.js` like the following:\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  src=\"/customize/manifest.js?ver=h%2BtOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy%2BgoBwNEELZk%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nYou will notice that the hash is used also in the URL of `manifest.js`, this allows the server to signal that the files are immutable and can be cached by the browser forever which makes CryptPad load faster next time.\n\nAfter `manifest.js` loads, `sboot.js` finds the hash of `require.js` in the manifest and then manually loads `require.js` in the same way. Once `require.js` is loaded, `sboot.js` configures require to use the hashes from the manifest for every file it loads, then it uses require to load `boot2.js`.\n\n### boot2.js\n\nThis file is not needed for security, but unlike `sboot.js`, it can easily be changed from release to release and it contains any code which should be run before the main CryptPad code. Things such as additional requirejs configuration and shims for missing browser APIs are placed here. After `boot2.js` is complete, it reads the `data-bootload` attribute from the html file and invokes require to load that.\n\n## Further development\n\nWhile this system provides excellent security, it is still not perfect. If the root html file is compromized then it can alter the chain of trust, or scrap it completely. With a very long cache header, the browser will store the html file essentially forever, but if the user triggers a hard reload with the F5 key, then the cache will be flushed.\n\nThe root html file can be signed using pgp and then verified using the [signed pages](https://github.com/tasn/webext-signed-pages) chrome extension. But signed pages is not able to prevent the loading of the website even if the signature is invalid and it only takes 1 second for the keys in localStorage to be leaked.\n\nIf the root html file was *generated* by the server each load, it could contain a secret key which is used to encrypt the keys in the localStorage, thus rendering them unusable if the html file is re-loaded, and meaning that the user must re-enter their password and would then be able to see that the signature on the html file is invalid, however unless signed pages can ignore the key inside of the html file when verifying the signature, it would have to be re-signed every time, pushing the pgp key onto the server, which we are worried about being compromized.\n\nThere are also a number of configuration files in the CryptPad project which are in fact javascript files and would thus be signed by the release manager, preventing anyone hosting CryptPad from changing them so it may be a long time before this project is merged into CryptPad mainline, however it is available and you can experiment with it by checking out the [code-integrity](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/code-integrity) branch of the CryptPad project.","source":"_posts/Signing-CryptPad.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Signing CryptPad\ndate: 2018-06-15 12:07:05\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - signing\n  - subresource integrity\n  - chain of trust\n---\n\nCryptPad was designed with a view that privacy should be default and cryptography should be invisible.

Finally, in order to add a layer of security against possible Cross Site Scripting attacks, CryptPad makes use of a [cross domain iframe](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/), protecting your encryption keys from the majority of the CryptPad code in the same way that your online bank is protected from that sketchy porn site open in another tab.\n\nSince CryptPad has no build system, there are many small javascript files which must be loaded. To do this, CryptPad uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). While many small files are generally considered to be bad for website performance, RequireJS uses the HTML5 [async attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) to tell the browser not to block loading of other things while waiting for the scripts to load. Secondly, RequireJS also allows version numbers to be added to the script URLs which allows us to cache almost everything in the browser. Finally, we use the [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) protocol to serve resources because it allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time, while HTTP/2 is incompatible with WebSocket, this is ok because the web-app is served from a different server from the API server.\n\n## Chain of Trust\n\nJust one corrupted script is enough to render the security of an entire web-app useless, so in CryptPad we needed the signing to cover all javascript files. Fortunately there is a new HTML5 technology called [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) which allows putting the hash of a script in a script tag attribute and makes the browser verify the script before executing it.\n\nInsecure, some.website can serve you anything:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSecure, only one possible script can be sent by some.website or else the web browser will throw an error and refuse to run the script:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-G1KwaJYUEDsA1SD/6Wt4z0laskKzIwgqgs5cYH0CW/o=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSo rather than signing every script, I only needed to make a list of hashes of every script, and sign that. What I needed was a way to generate a *manifest*, and so I developed a small program which could hash all of the javascript files in CryptPad and generate a manifest file. The content of the manifest looks something like this:\n\n```\n\"files\": {\n  \"assert\": {\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"frame.js\": \"BrN2JNnK4QJCztw3PyRRPAsEwSq5lczTBrRkzdLAFow=\",\n      \"respond.js\": \"yO0KFMHiCdE1fXFWPVaFB+Mmh37OCl/UNPpXrYtWF7A=\"\n    },\n    \"main.js\": \"ABf3uhmYVHWaHX6vhK8K2jAUY8XqRjjMJ2FqXVGLZE0=\",\n    \"translations\": {\n      \"main.js\": \"50Ami2eghyXcGKGYTaDK1vUeEuAEG7kcpvUoCKbUaUU=\"\n```\n\nIt contains a JSON tree which mirrors the files that are part of the CryptPad codebase and the hashes of the files for the Subresource Integrity check. Once the `manifest.js` file was created, then I needed a javascript file which would load and verify it. Since the manifest is different every time a new release is made, the verification of the manifest needed to be via *signing*. The manifest hash was signed along with a version number and those were placed in a file called `version.txt` and `version.txt` is loaded using a file called `sboot.js`. The hash of `sboot.js` was included directly into the html files which are cached, so `sboot.js` can never be changed at all.\n\n## Loading process\n\n### index.html\nFirst, the browser loads the html file, the html file contains a single script tag loading `sboot.js`\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  data-bootload=\"/customize/template.js\"\n  src=\"/common/sboot.js?ver=8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk%2B%2BVQ%2BBk83mRdXx4dK%2BXvSNPcI%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk++VQ+Bk83mRdXx4dK+XvSNPcI=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nThere is a custom attribute called `data-bootload` which indicates which javascript file should be loaded for that `html` file.\n\n### sboot.js\n\nWhen `sboot.js` gets loaded, it downloads and then verifies `version.txt` which is a signed message containing the CryptPad version number and the hash of `manifest.js`. The content that is signed looks something like this:\n\n```\n[85,\"h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"]\n```\n\nThe version number (85) is not the CryptPad version but rather an auto-incrementing number which is stored in the browser localStorage and prevents the server from downgrading the version of CryptPad. After the signature/version check completes successfully, `sboot.js` loads `manifest.js` like the following:\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  src=\"/customize/manifest.js?ver=h%2BtOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy%2BgoBwNEELZk%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nYou will notice that the hash is used also in the URL of `manifest.js`, this allows the server to signal that the files are immutable and can be cached by the browser forever which makes CryptPad load faster next time.\n\nAfter `manifest.js` loads, `sboot.js` finds the hash of `require.js` in the manifest and then manually loads `require.js` in the same way. Once `require.js` is loaded, `sboot.js` configures require to use the hashes from the manifest for every file it loads, then it uses require to load `boot2.js`.\n\n### boot2.js\n\nThis file is not needed for security, but unlike `sboot.js`, it can easily be changed from release to release and it contains any code which should be run before the main CryptPad code. Things such as additional requirejs configuration and shims for missing browser APIs are placed here. After `boot2.js` is complete, it reads the `data-bootload` attribute from the html file and invokes require to load that.\n\n## Further development\n\nWhile this system provides excellent security, it is still not perfect. If the root html file is compromized then it can alter the chain of trust, or scrap it completely. With a very long cache header, the browser will store the html file essentially forever, but if the user triggers a hard reload with the F5 key, then the cache will be flushed.\n\nThe root html file can be signed using pgp and then verified using the [signed pages](https://github.com/tasn/webext-signed-pages) chrome extension. But signed pages is not able to prevent the loading of the website even if the signature is invalid and it only takes 1 second for the keys in localStorage to be leaked.\n\nIf the root html file was *generated* by the server each load, it could contain a secret key which is used to encrypt the keys in the localStorage, thus rendering them unusable if the html file is re-loaded, and meaning that the user must re-enter their password and would then be able to see that the signature on the html file is invalid, however unless signed pages can ignore the key inside of the html file when verifying the signature, it would have to be re-signed every time, pushing the pgp key onto the server, which we are worried about being compromized.\n\nThere are also a number of configuration files in the CryptPad project which are in fact javascript files and would thus be signed by the release manager, preventing anyone hosting CryptPad from changing them so it may be a long time before this project is merged into CryptPad mainline, however it is available and you can experiment with it by checking out the [code-integrity](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/code-integrity) branch of the CryptPad project.","slug":"Signing-CryptPad","published":1,"updated":"2018-08-07T13:19:41.279Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cktsjy9v2001lcya8evoth9fh","content":"<p>CryptPad was designed with a view that privacy should be default and cryptography should be invisible.

The hash of <code>sboot.js</code> was included directly into the html files which are cached, so <code>sboot.js</code> can never be changed at all.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Loading-process\"><a href=\"#Loading-process\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Loading process\"></a>Loading process</h2><h3 id=\"index-html\"><a href=\"#index-html\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"index.html\"></a>index.html</h3><p>First, the browser loads the html file, the html file contains a single script tag loading <code>sboot.js</code></p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">&lt;script</span><br><span class=\"line\">  async</span><br><span class=\"line\">  data-bootload=&quot;/customize/template.js&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  src=&quot;/common/sboot.js?ver=8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk%2B%2BVQ%2BBk83mRdXx4dK%2BXvSNPcI%3D&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">  integrity=&quot;sha256-8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk++VQ+Bk83mRdXx4dK+XvSNPcI=&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>There is a custom attribute called <code>data-bootload</code> which indicates which javascript file should be loaded for that <code>html</code> file.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sboot-js\"><a href=\"#sboot-js\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"sboot.js\"></a>sboot.js</h3><p>When <code>sboot.js</code> gets loaded, it downloads and then verifies <code>version.txt</code> which is a signed message containing the CryptPad version number and the hash of <code>manifest.js</code>.

The service was unavailable for approximately 27 hours while we diagnosed a corrupted OS, provisioned a new server, and migrated user data to the new system.\n\n## What happened\n\nOur team works remotely across three different timezones, so for the sake of simplicity I'll summarize the timeline of the service outage in Central European Time (CET) using a 24-hour clock.\n\n### December 8, 05:30 - Server update deployed\n\nI occasionally start my working days very early in the morning when we have as few users connected as possible. On the days where a server restart is necessary, I do it at this time to minimize the number of active users that might be inconvenienced by the momentary service interruption.\n\nDuring the process of deploying a minor patch to optimize how the service loads and evicts document metadata I noticed that our monthly full-disk backup was running. We run a less intensive incremental backup on a daily basis, but having a regular full-disk backup ensures that restoration does not become increasingly difficult over time.\n\nWe've been breaking our records for the highest ever number of concurrent users on CryptPad.fr on a regular basis, so I tend to pay close attention to how our server is performing and how small changes in our code affect its performance.\n\n![A record number of concurrently connected clients, as reported by our admin panel](/images/3000-connections.png)\n\nMy colleagues hadn't started their shifts yet, but I left a message informing them that the server would probably be under more load than usual. We were considering also deploying an update to our client code, but we usually avoid doing so on backup days to help ensure that things go smoothly.\n\n![Me jinxing our server for the day](/images/poor-server-performance.png)\n\n### December 8, 12:42 - CryptPad goes down\n\nCryptPad is developed by a company called [XWiki](https://xwiki.com/). We host everything using virtual machines provisioned on the same dedicated physical servers as the rest of the company's infrastructure. Performance metrics and monitoring for our other sites suggests that the host machine did not fail instantly, rather, its performance degraded over a relatively short period of time. Some services failed sooner as the host system tried to de-prioritize less critical systems.\n\nThe last line in our server's log was written to the disk at 12:42. I was away from my desk to eat a meal, so I didn't notice that anything had gone wrong. I returned to find some user reports sent at around 13:00 that the service had been unavailable for some time. We occasionally receive such reports that turn out to be user error (typos in URLs or DNS problems), but in this case it was easy to confirm as a systemic problem since my CryptPad tabs were also disconnected.\n\nMy first assumption was that an error in the the code I'd deployed earlier in the day that had caused the server to crash. I tried to log into our servers from my terminal with no success, then tried to ping the server's domain name, then its raw IP address, at which point I realized that the machine was completely powered down or otherwise unreachable.\n\nThe last time we were surprised with this kind of outage was in [November 2017](https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/09/ovh_datacenters_go_titsup/) when a power outage and a generator failure took several data-centers completely offline. That outage lasted 3.5 hours, which seemed very bad at the time, but I was expecting something similar.\n\n### December 8, 13:35 - Infra is on it\n\nSince the same physical infrastructure hosts a large number of sites the outage had been noticed by many of our company's employees almost instantly. We have lots of monitoring in place to send warnings when things are performing poorly (or not at all), but I learned via our company's internal chat service that at least one of our physical servers had had a critical failure and that Kevin (our resident infra expert) was working on it. CryptPad's track record for uptime until this point was very good, and most of that was due to Kevin, so I tried to leave him alone so he could focus on diagnosing and possibly fixing the problem. Since there didn't seem to be anything I could do on that front to help the situation I started to respond to the related GitHub issues and messages in our public chat channel to inform our users what was going on.\n\nAt this point I also noticed several messages from my colleagues congratulating me on my five-year anniversary at the company. I'd forgotten the date, and grateful as I was for the wishes, this wasn't how I'd expected to celebrate the milestone.\n\n### December 8, 15:00 - Host machine comes back online\n\nBy 15:00 the physical server that had gone offline had been powered back up. This meant that VMware (the software we use to host many virtual machines on one very powerful machine) was running again, though some more work was needed to bring many of its hosted VMs back online. Kevin immediately began running a range of integrity checks to confirm that the hardware was functioning correctly before relaunching services. Some VMs that required fewer resources were able to be re-launched very quickly, but CryptPad requires more storage than most of the wikis we host, and disk checks tend to require more time than other diagnostics.\n\nAt 15:40 these disk integrity checks were interrupted when one of the data-center technicians (who I'm sure was also having a bad day) had to take the server back offline to transfer our hardware to a new location in the same building. Access was restored just a few minutes later, but we had to restart our integrity checks.\n\n### December 8, 16:20 - First disk integrity check completes\n\nForty minutes after the manual intervention, the first of three disk checkups had completed. VMware was reporting that all systems were operational, however, the VM that usually hosts our API server was failing to boot. Kevin was able to launch a Debian rescue system from a live disk and mount the system for inspection, but there was still no obvious indication why the system wouldn't boot. He proceeded to launch checks for the remaining two disks while he continued to search for the cause of the failure.\n\n### December 8, 18:30 - Initial failure traced to a cooling malfunction\n\nThroughout the duration of this downtime Kevin had been on and off the phone with the data-center technicians getting updates about what had happened and whether we should expect any further problems. By 18:30 we were informed of the cooling system's malfunction. While it was somewhat comforting to know that the problem had nothing to do with code we'd written, it was also frustrating to be reminded that there will likely always be physical events like this that we can neither control nor predict.\n\n![](/images/physical-internet.png)\n\nAs twitter user [@RimaSghaier](https://twitter.com/RimaSghaier/status/1336398196109697025) noted, the internet is still _very physical_.\n\n### December 8, 19:30 - File transfer commences\n\nBy 19:30, between myself, Kevin, Ludovic (the company's CEO), and one of Ludovic's friends who has some more experience with the intricacies of bootable filesystems,  we'd made no progress diagnosing why the affected VM would not boot outside of the environment of the rescue disk. We had access to all the system's files and all of the integrity checks had passed, but there seemed to be problem with the root filesystem. We decided that the safest thing to do was to provision a new VM and begin transferring the relevant files. We could interrupt the process if we discovered the reason for the failure, but it was already late in the day and we had no promising leads.\n\nIt took only a few minutes to provision a nearly identical VM and we immediately began transferring files via the data-center's internal network. Unfortunately, there was around 750GB of data to transfer at a variable rate that did not seem very promising.\n\nUntil this point I'd been very hopeful that _at any minute_ we would find some trick to get the original server back online. As it became increasingly apparent that this was unlikely and that we'd need to wait for the file transfer to finish we shifted our focus to damage control.\n\nThe API server that hosts our database and Nodejs server had been offline, but we actually serve our static assets (HTML, Javascript, etc) from a different machine that had stayed online. I'd been distracted by the actual system outage and hadn't thought to update our front-end to inform all our users of what was going on, though I had been posting to our [Mastodon](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cryptpad) accounts.\n\nI hacked together and deployed some very basic HTML as quickly as I could, explaining what was happening and directing users to our social media for updates. This was deployed by 19:43.\n\n![CryptPad's down page](/images/cryptpad-down-page.png)\n\n### December 8, 20:00 - I try to get some sleep\n\nFinally, after about 7 hours of downtime and a 14.5 hour shift on my part, we left the servers alone to continue their work and decided to get some rest for the following day. We expected the file transfer to take at least 10 more hours to complete, so I set my alarm for the following morning and called it a day.\n\n### December 9, 16:14\n\nDecember 9th was not especially eventful. I spent most of the day idly monitoring the progress of the network file transfer. I was far too distracted to be productive with anything else, and anyway it seemed prudent to save my energy for when the transfer completed.\n\nBy about 13:30 the transfer was 90% complete and I began to pre-configure as much as possible on the new system so that we could bring everything back up as quickly as possible. I prepared and reviewed a list of final tasks with Kevin and Yann in the final 30 minutes of the transfer, and we started working as soon as it finished.\n\nWe were able to complete the system's setup in around 20 minutes, including a last-minute configuration fix to restrict the service to our IP addresses before we launched it. This restriction allowed us to access CryptPad as normal before anyone else. We took about ten minutes to test the platform, loading any documents we'd been editing leading up to the crash and confirming that everything was behaving as expected.\n\nFinally, by 16:14, after a bit more than 27 hours of downtime, we removed the IP address restriction and removed the downtime notice I'd deployed the evening before.\n\n\n## Difficulties and lessons learned\n\nI'll start by saying in very simple terms that _this experience **sucked**_. I know it was very frustrating for our users who couldn't access their documents while the server was offline. I certainly had a terrible two shifts. It was stressful for everyone on our team, and I suspect it was similarly unpleasant for the data-center technicians as well.\n\nIt should be more obvious given the root meaning of the word _internet_, but we all depend on many systems functioning to maintain our daily routines. The majority of our users only contact us to report bugs. Kevin and I mostly end up chatting when one of us notices irregular server behaviour. We only contact OVH when our servers have problems, and they probably don't deal too much with their municipal electricity and fuel providers except when their power goes out and they fall back to using generators. _We are most aware of the systems that sustain us when they break_.\n\nOn a positive note, though, I was pleasantly surprised by how understanding people were about the situation. One of our paying users cancelled their subscription, but it seems the outage served to remind many people that there are humans working on this project, and so we've actually seen an increase in the rate of donations and subscriptions in the week since. We greatly appreciate everyone's generosity!\n\nSome users seem to have understandably lost some confidence in our platform, as we've seen slightly fewer users at the usual peak hours (2700 concurrent connections instead of 3000). On the other hand, it seems like the downtime page led to a significant increase in our follower count on social media.\n\nMany of our users rely on CryptPad as a persistent home for their documents, and in these cases downtime is very inconvenient. During the outage, however, I learned about [this software](https://github.com/tosterkamp/random-redirect) which randomly redirects users to publicly hosted instances of open-source software platforms. If you use CryptPad as a place to collaborate rather than a place to store documents, then you could try [cryptpad.random-redirect.de](https://cryptpad.random-redirect.de/) to find alternatives. If you host a CryptPad instance you could even inquire about adding your server to the list. One of the great things about open-source software is that failures that affect one server or service do not need to have global effects.\n\nDespite the positive aspects of our community's response to this event, I regret that it took so long migrate to a new machine. The simple fact is that while we (mostly Kevin and Ludovic) have put in a lot of effort to making sure that our hosting infrastructure is reliable, we were unprepared for the task of rapidly migrating our entire database to a new machine. We're hosting about six times more data now than we were at the start of the year. Until now we've had little cause to consider the increasing difficulty of managing this growing dataset and with everything else that has happened this year there has been little opportunity to do so. This event made it abundantly clear that we're going to have to find the required time.\n\n## What we plan to do\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that I have a bit of an idealist stance when it comes to software. This is why I work on open-source, privacy-preserving tech. It's terrible that modern, web-based software is as fragile as it is. That said, the alternative of emailing static documents to colleagues (or between devices) also makes it difficult to be productive.\n\nIt's a bit ridiculous that a broken cooling system in northern France can mean that our 20,000 daily active users lose the ability to edit or even read their documents for more than a day. More frustrating is the fact that we were very nearly in a good position to mitigate many of the adverse effects of this outage. We've been working on some new _offline-first_ functionality in CryptPad over the last few months and, as noted above, we were considering deploying the first phase of these improvements the day of the outage.\n\nOur first offline features were deployed yesterday as a part of our [3.25.0 release](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/3.25.0). Now, every time you load a document in CryptPad you're also populating an advanced cache in your browser. For now this only has the effect of reducing the total time to load cached documents, since we still wait for confirmation from the server that this is the most recent version of the content before removing the loading screen.\n\nOur next step will be to merge a branch of our code which will instead load and display the last known state of any document in your local cache in offline mode, regardless of whether you're able to reach our database server. This would have alleviated some of the inconvenience of our outage, since users were still able to load the platform's HTML and JavaScript that would have at least let them access cached documents.\n\nThe next major feature will be the use of [service-workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to enable browsers to use very advanced caching policies and load our client-side code even while entirely offline, allowing full access to cached documents under almost any circumstance. We expect to deploy these updates in early January 2021 as a part of our upcoming _4.0.0_ release.\n\n[One of my favourite academic papers](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/paper/grayfailure-hotos17.pdf) defines the term **gray failures**, in which well-intentioned attempts to introduce redundancy into online systems can paradoxically increases the likelihood of service degradation or interruptions. In the last few weeks both Amazon and Google (some of the richest companies on the planet, in case you haven't heard of them) have experienced severe service outages. There are very few easy answers in this area, but we're going to learn from this situation and work on solutions that would have helped at least let us recover more quickly.\n\nIf the next data-center failure happens in another three years I hope it will only last a small fraction of the time, and that our software will be so resilient you'll hardly notice. In the meantime our team greatly appreciates all your support!\n\n","source":"_posts/The-outage-of-December-8th-2020-a-postmortem.md","raw":"---\ntitle: The outage of December 8th, 2020 - a postmortem\ndate: 2020-12-16 15:30:00\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  - cloud\n  - storage\n---\n\n\nOn December 8th, 2020 a malfunction in the water-cooling system at a data-center in Roubaix, France caused an unrecoverable error in the physical machine which hosts CryptPad.fr.

This was deployed by 19:43.\n\n![CryptPad's down page](/images/cryptpad-down-page.png)\n\n### December 8, 20:00 - I try to get some sleep\n\nFinally, after about 7 hours of downtime and a 14.5 hour shift on my part, we left the servers alone to continue their work and decided to get some rest for the following day. We expected the file transfer to take at least 10 more hours to complete, so I set my alarm for the following morning and called it a day.\n\n### December 9, 16:14\n\nDecember 9th was not especially eventful. I spent most of the day idly monitoring the progress of the network file transfer. I was far too distracted to be productive with anything else, and anyway it seemed prudent to save my energy for when the transfer completed.\n\nBy about 13:30 the transfer was 90% complete and I began to pre-configure as much as possible on the new system so that we could bring everything back up as quickly as possible. I prepared and reviewed a list of final tasks with Kevin and Yann in the final 30 minutes of the transfer, and we started working as soon as it finished.\n\nWe were able to complete the system's setup in around 20 minutes, including a last-minute configuration fix to restrict the service to our IP addresses before we launched it. This restriction allowed us to access CryptPad as normal before anyone else. We took about ten minutes to test the platform, loading any documents we'd been editing leading up to the crash and confirming that everything was behaving as expected.\n\nFinally, by 16:14, after a bit more than 27 hours of downtime, we removed the IP address restriction and removed the downtime notice I'd deployed the evening before.\n\n\n## Difficulties and lessons learned\n\nI'll start by saying in very simple terms that _this experience **sucked**_. I know it was very frustrating for our users who couldn't access their documents while the server was offline. I certainly had a terrible two shifts. It was stressful for everyone on our team, and I suspect it was similarly unpleasant for the data-center technicians as well.\n\nIt should be more obvious given the root meaning of the word _internet_, but we all depend on many systems functioning to maintain our daily routines. The majority of our users only contact us to report bugs. Kevin and I mostly end up chatting when one of us notices irregular server behaviour. We only contact OVH when our servers have problems, and they probably don't deal too much with their municipal electricity and fuel providers except when their power goes out and they fall back to using generators. _We are most aware of the systems that sustain us when they break_.\n\nOn a positive note, though, I was pleasantly surprised by how understanding people were about the situation. One of our paying users cancelled their subscription, but it seems the outage served to remind many people that there are humans working on this project, and so we've actually seen an increase in the rate of donations and subscriptions in the week since. We greatly appreciate everyone's generosity!\n\nSome users seem to have understandably lost some confidence in our platform, as we've seen slightly fewer users at the usual peak hours (2700 concurrent connections instead of 3000). On the other hand, it seems like the downtime page led to a significant increase in our follower count on social media.\n\nMany of our users rely on CryptPad as a persistent home for their documents, and in these cases downtime is very inconvenient. During the outage, however, I learned about [this software](https://github.com/tosterkamp/random-redirect) which randomly redirects users to publicly hosted instances of open-source software platforms. If you use CryptPad as a place to collaborate rather than a place to store documents, then you could try [cryptpad.random-redirect.de](https://cryptpad.random-redirect.de/) to find alternatives. If you host a CryptPad instance you could even inquire about adding your server to the list. One of the great things about open-source software is that failures that affect one server or service do not need to have global effects.\n\nDespite the positive aspects of our community's response to this event, I regret that it took so long migrate to a new machine. The simple fact is that while we (mostly Kevin and Ludovic) have put in a lot of effort to making sure that our hosting infrastructure is reliable, we were unprepared for the task of rapidly migrating our entire database to a new machine. We're hosting about six times more data now than we were at the start of the year. Until now we've had little cause to consider the increasing difficulty of managing this growing dataset and with everything else that has happened this year there has been little opportunity to do so. This event made it abundantly clear that we're going to have to find the required time.\n\n## What we plan to do\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that I have a bit of an idealist stance when it comes to software. This is why I work on open-source, privacy-preserving tech. It's terrible that modern, web-based software is as fragile as it is. That said, the alternative of emailing static documents to colleagues (or between devices) also makes it difficult to be productive.\n\nIt's a bit ridiculous that a broken cooling system in northern France can mean that our 20,000 daily active users lose the ability to edit or even read their documents for more than a day. More frustrating is the fact that we were very nearly in a good position to mitigate many of the adverse effects of this outage. We've been working on some new _offline-first_ functionality in CryptPad over the last few months and, as noted above, we were considering deploying the first phase of these improvements the day of the outage.\n\nOur first offline features were deployed yesterday as a part of our [3.25.0 release](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/3.25.0). Now, every time you load a document in CryptPad you're also populating an advanced cache in your browser. For now this only has the effect of reducing the total time to load cached documents, since we still wait for confirmation from the server that this is the most recent version of the content before removing the loading screen.\n\nOur next step will be to merge a branch of our code which will instead load and display the last known state of any document in your local cache in offline mode, regardless of whether you're able to reach our database server. This would have alleviated some of the inconvenience of our outage, since users were still able to load the platform's HTML and JavaScript that would have at least let them access cached documents.\n\nThe next major feature will be the use of [service-workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to enable browsers to use very advanced caching policies and load our client-side code even while entirely offline, allowing full access to cached documents under almost any circumstance. We expect to deploy these updates in early January 2021 as a part of our upcoming _4.0.0_ release.\n\n[One of my favourite academic papers](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/paper/grayfailure-hotos17.pdf) defines the term **gray failures**, in which well-intentioned attempts to introduce redundancy into online systems can paradoxically increases the likelihood of service degradation or interruptions. In the last few weeks both Amazon and Google (some of the richest companies on the planet, in case you haven't heard of them) have experienced severe service outages. There are very few easy answers in this area, but we're going to learn from this situation and work on solutions that would have helped at least let us recover more quickly.\n\nIf the next data-center failure happens in another three years I hope it will only last a small fraction of the time, and that our software will be so resilient you'll hardly notice. In the meantime our team greatly appreciates all your support!\n\n","slug":"The-outage-of-December-8th-2020-a-postmortem","published":1,"updated":"2021-01-21T14:43:32.374Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cktsjy9v4001ocya8a3fqj65h","content":"<p>On December 8th, 2020 a malfunction in the water-cooling system at a data-center in Roubaix, France caused an unrecoverable error in the physical machine which hosts CryptPad.fr.

We host everything using virtual machines provisioned on the same dedicated physical servers as the rest of the company’s infrastructure. Performance metrics and monitoring for our other sites suggests that the host machine did not fail instantly, rather, its performance degraded over a relatively short period of time. Some services failed sooner as the host system tried to de-prioritize less critical systems.</p>\n<p>The last line in our server’s log was written to the disk at 12:42. I was away from my desk to eat a meal, so I didn’t notice that anything had gone wrong. I returned to find some user reports sent at around 13:00 that the service had been unavailable for some time. We occasionally receive such reports that turn out to be user error (typos in URLs or DNS problems), but in this case it was easy to confirm as a systemic problem since my CryptPad tabs were also disconnected.</p>\n<p>My first assumption was that an error in the the code I’d deployed earlier in the day that had caused the server to crash. I tried to log into our servers from my terminal with no success, then tried to ping the server’s domain name, then its raw IP address, at which point I realized that the machine was completely powered down or otherwise unreachable.</p>\n<p>The last time we were surprised with this kind of outage was in <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/09/ovh_datacenters_go_titsup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November 2017</a> when a power outage and a generator failure took several data-centers completely offline. That outage lasted 3.5 hours, which seemed very bad at the time, but I was expecting something similar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-13-35-Infra-is-on-it\"><a href=\"#December-8-13-35-Infra-is-on-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 13:35 - Infra is on it\"></a>December 8, 13:35 - Infra is on it</h3><p>Since the same physical infrastructure hosts a large number of sites the outage had been noticed by many of our company’s employees almost instantly. We have lots of monitoring in place to send warnings when things are performing poorly (or not at all), but I learned via our company’s internal chat service that at least one of our physical servers had had a critical failure and that Kevin (our resident infra expert) was working on it. CryptPad’s track record for uptime until this point was very good, and most of that was due to Kevin, so I tried to leave him alone so he could focus on diagnosing and possibly fixing the problem. Since there didn’t seem to be anything I could do on that front to help the situation I started to respond to the related GitHub issues and messages in our public chat channel to inform our users what was going on.</p>\n<p>At this point I also noticed several messages from my colleagues congratulating me on my five-year anniversary at the company. I’d forgotten the date, and grateful as I was for the wishes, this wasn’t how I’d expected to celebrate the milestone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-15-00-Host-machine-comes-back-online\"><a href=\"#December-8-15-00-Host-machine-comes-back-online\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 15:00 - Host machine comes back online\"></a>December 8, 15:00 - Host machine comes back online</h3><p>By 15:00 the physical server that had gone offline had been powered back up. This meant that VMware (the software we use to host many virtual machines on one very powerful machine) was running again, though some more work was needed to bring many of its hosted VMs back online. Kevin immediately began running a range of integrity checks to confirm that the hardware was functioning correctly before relaunching services. Some VMs that required fewer resources were able to be re-launched very quickly, but CryptPad requires more storage than most of the wikis we host, and disk checks tend to require more time than other diagnostics.</p>\n<p>At 15:40 these disk integrity checks were interrupted when one of the data-center technicians (who I’m sure was also having a bad day) had to take the server back offline to transfer our hardware to a new location in the same building. Access was restored just a few minutes later, but we had to restart our integrity checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-16-20-First-disk-integrity-check-completes\"><a href=\"#December-8-16-20-First-disk-integrity-check-completes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 16:20 - First disk integrity check completes\"></a>December 8, 16:20 - First disk integrity check completes</h3><p>Forty minutes after the manual intervention, the first of three disk checkups had completed. VMware was reporting that all systems were operational, however, the VM that usually hosts our API server was failing to boot. Kevin was able to launch a Debian rescue system from a live disk and mount the system for inspection, but there was still no obvious indication why the system wouldn’t boot. He proceeded to launch checks for the remaining two disks while he continued to search for the cause of the failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-18-30-Initial-failure-traced-to-a-cooling-malfunction\"><a href=\"#December-8-18-30-Initial-failure-traced-to-a-cooling-malfunction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 18:30 - Initial failure traced to a cooling malfunction\"></a>December 8, 18:30 - Initial failure traced to a cooling malfunction</h3><p>Throughout the duration of this downtime Kevin had been on and off the phone with the data-center technicians getting updates about what had happened and whether we should expect any further problems. By 18:30 we were informed of the cooling system’s malfunction. While it was somewhat comforting to know that the problem had nothing to do with code we’d written, it was also frustrating to be reminded that there will likely always be physical events like this that we can neither control nor predict.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/physical-internet.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RimaSghaier/status/1336398196109697025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@RimaSghaier</a> noted, the internet is still <em>very physical</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-19-30-File-transfer-commences\"><a href=\"#December-8-19-30-File-transfer-commences\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 19:30 - File transfer commences\"></a>December 8, 19:30 - File transfer commences</h3><p>By 19:30, between myself, Kevin, Ludovic (the company’s CEO), and one of Ludovic’s friends who has some more experience with the intricacies of bootable filesystems,  we’d made no progress diagnosing why the affected VM would not boot outside of the environment of the rescue disk. We had access to all the system’s files and all of the integrity checks had passed, but there seemed to be problem with the root filesystem. We decided that the safest thing to do was to provision a new VM and begin transferring the relevant files. We could interrupt the process if we discovered the reason for the failure, but it was already late in the day and we had no promising leads.</p>\n<p>It took only a few minutes to provision a nearly identical VM and we immediately began transferring files via the data-center’s internal network. Unfortunately, there was around 750GB of data to transfer at a variable rate that did not seem very promising.</p>\n<p>Until this point I’d been very hopeful that <em>at any minute</em> we would find some trick to get the original server back online.

I tried to log into our servers from my terminal with no success, then tried to ping the server’s domain name, then its raw IP address, at which point I realized that the machine was completely powered down or otherwise unreachable.</p>\n<p>The last time we were surprised with this kind of outage was in <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2017/11/09/ovh_datacenters_go_titsup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">November 2017</a> when a power outage and a generator failure took several data-centers completely offline. That outage lasted 3.5 hours, which seemed very bad at the time, but I was expecting something similar.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-13-35-Infra-is-on-it\"><a href=\"#December-8-13-35-Infra-is-on-it\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 13:35 - Infra is on it\"></a>December 8, 13:35 - Infra is on it</h3><p>Since the same physical infrastructure hosts a large number of sites the outage had been noticed by many of our company’s employees almost instantly. We have lots of monitoring in place to send warnings when things are performing poorly (or not at all), but I learned via our company’s internal chat service that at least one of our physical servers had had a critical failure and that Kevin (our resident infra expert) was working on it. CryptPad’s track record for uptime until this point was very good, and most of that was due to Kevin, so I tried to leave him alone so he could focus on diagnosing and possibly fixing the problem. Since there didn’t seem to be anything I could do on that front to help the situation I started to respond to the related GitHub issues and messages in our public chat channel to inform our users what was going on.</p>\n<p>At this point I also noticed several messages from my colleagues congratulating me on my five-year anniversary at the company. I’d forgotten the date, and grateful as I was for the wishes, this wasn’t how I’d expected to celebrate the milestone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-15-00-Host-machine-comes-back-online\"><a href=\"#December-8-15-00-Host-machine-comes-back-online\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 15:00 - Host machine comes back online\"></a>December 8, 15:00 - Host machine comes back online</h3><p>By 15:00 the physical server that had gone offline had been powered back up. This meant that VMware (the software we use to host many virtual machines on one very powerful machine) was running again, though some more work was needed to bring many of its hosted VMs back online. Kevin immediately began running a range of integrity checks to confirm that the hardware was functioning correctly before relaunching services. Some VMs that required fewer resources were able to be re-launched very quickly, but CryptPad requires more storage than most of the wikis we host, and disk checks tend to require more time than other diagnostics.</p>\n<p>At 15:40 these disk integrity checks were interrupted when one of the data-center technicians (who I’m sure was also having a bad day) had to take the server back offline to transfer our hardware to a new location in the same building. Access was restored just a few minutes later, but we had to restart our integrity checks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-16-20-First-disk-integrity-check-completes\"><a href=\"#December-8-16-20-First-disk-integrity-check-completes\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 16:20 - First disk integrity check completes\"></a>December 8, 16:20 - First disk integrity check completes</h3><p>Forty minutes after the manual intervention, the first of three disk checkups had completed. VMware was reporting that all systems were operational, however, the VM that usually hosts our API server was failing to boot. Kevin was able to launch a Debian rescue system from a live disk and mount the system for inspection, but there was still no obvious indication why the system wouldn’t boot. He proceeded to launch checks for the remaining two disks while he continued to search for the cause of the failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-18-30-Initial-failure-traced-to-a-cooling-malfunction\"><a href=\"#December-8-18-30-Initial-failure-traced-to-a-cooling-malfunction\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 18:30 - Initial failure traced to a cooling malfunction\"></a>December 8, 18:30 - Initial failure traced to a cooling malfunction</h3><p>Throughout the duration of this downtime Kevin had been on and off the phone with the data-center technicians getting updates about what had happened and whether we should expect any further problems. By 18:30 we were informed of the cooling system’s malfunction. While it was somewhat comforting to know that the problem had nothing to do with code we’d written, it was also frustrating to be reminded that there will likely always be physical events like this that we can neither control nor predict.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/physical-internet.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As twitter user <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RimaSghaier/status/1336398196109697025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@RimaSghaier</a> noted, the internet is still <em>very physical</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-19-30-File-transfer-commences\"><a href=\"#December-8-19-30-File-transfer-commences\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 19:30 - File transfer commences\"></a>December 8, 19:30 - File transfer commences</h3><p>By 19:30, between myself, Kevin, Ludovic (the company’s CEO), and one of Ludovic’s friends who has some more experience with the intricacies of bootable filesystems,  we’d made no progress diagnosing why the affected VM would not boot outside of the environment of the rescue disk. We had access to all the system’s files and all of the integrity checks had passed, but there seemed to be problem with the root filesystem. We decided that the safest thing to do was to provision a new VM and begin transferring the relevant files. We could interrupt the process if we discovered the reason for the failure, but it was already late in the day and we had no promising leads.</p>\n<p>It took only a few minutes to provision a nearly identical VM and we immediately began transferring files via the data-center’s internal network. Unfortunately, there was around 750GB of data to transfer at a variable rate that did not seem very promising.</p>\n<p>Until this point I’d been very hopeful that <em>at any minute</em> we would find some trick to get the original server back online. As it became increasingly apparent that this was unlikely and that we’d need to wait for the file transfer to finish we shifted our focus to damage control.</p>\n<p>The API server that hosts our database and Nodejs server had been offline, but we actually serve our static assets (HTML, Javascript, etc) from a different machine that had stayed online. I’d been distracted by the actual system outage and hadn’t thought to update our front-end to inform all our users of what was going on, though I had been posting to our <a href=\"https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mastodon</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptpad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> accounts.</p>\n<p>I hacked together and deployed some very basic HTML as quickly as I could, explaining what was happening and directing users to our social media for updates. This was deployed by 19:43.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/cryptpad-down-page.png\" alt=\"CryptPad&#39;s down page\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"December-8-20-00-I-try-to-get-some-sleep\"><a href=\"#December-8-20-00-I-try-to-get-some-sleep\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 8, 20:00 - I try to get some sleep\"></a>December 8, 20:00 - I try to get some sleep</h3><p>Finally, after about 7 hours of downtime and a 14.5 hour shift on my part, we left the servers alone to continue their work and decided to get some rest for the following day. We expected the file transfer to take at least 10 more hours to complete, so I set my alarm for the following morning and called it a day.</p>\n<h3 id=\"December-9-16-14\"><a href=\"#December-9-16-14\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"December 9, 16:14\"></a>December 9, 16:14</h3><p>December 9th was not especially eventful. I spent most of the day idly monitoring the progress of the network file transfer. I was far too distracted to be productive with anything else, and anyway it seemed prudent to save my energy for when the transfer completed.</p>\n<p>By about 13:30 the transfer was 90% complete and I began to pre-configure as much as possible on the new system so that we could bring everything back up as quickly as possible. I prepared and reviewed a list of final tasks with Kevin and Yann in the final 30 minutes of the transfer, and we started working as soon as it finished.</p>\n<p>We were able to complete the system’s setup in around 20 minutes, including a last-minute configuration fix to restrict the service to our IP addresses before we launched it. This restriction allowed us to access CryptPad as normal before anyone else. We took about ten minutes to test the platform, loading any documents we’d been editing leading up to the crash and confirming that everything was behaving as expected.</p>\n<p>Finally, by 16:14, after a bit more than 27 hours of downtime, we removed the IP address restriction and removed the downtime notice I’d deployed the evening before.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Difficulties-and-lessons-learned\"><a href=\"#Difficulties-and-lessons-learned\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Difficulties and lessons learned\"></a>Difficulties and lessons learned</h2><p>I’ll start by saying in very simple terms that <em>this experience <strong>sucked</strong></em>. I know it was very frustrating for our users who couldn’t access their documents while the server was offline. I certainly had a terrible two shifts. It was stressful for everyone on our team, and I suspect it was similarly unpleasant for the data-center technicians as well.</p>\n<p>It should be more obvious given the root meaning of the word <em>internet</em>, but we all depend on many systems functioning to maintain our daily routines. The majority of our users only contact us to report bugs. Kevin and I mostly end up chatting when one of us notices irregular server behaviour. We only contact OVH when our servers have problems, and they probably don’t deal too much with their municipal electricity and fuel providers except when their power goes out and they fall back to using generators. <em>We are most aware of the systems that sustain us when they break</em>.</p>\n<p>On a positive note, though, I was pleasantly surprised by how understanding people were about the situation. One of our paying users cancelled their subscription, but it seems the outage served to remind many people that there are humans working on this project, and so we’ve actually seen an increase in the rate of donations and subscriptions in the week since. We greatly appreciate everyone’s generosity!</p>\n<p>Some users seem to have understandably lost some confidence in our platform, as we’ve seen slightly fewer users at the usual peak hours (2700 concurrent connections instead of 3000). On the other hand, it seems like the downtime page led to a significant increase in our follower count on social media.</p>\n<p>Many of our users rely on CryptPad as a persistent home for their documents, and in these cases downtime is very inconvenient. During the outage, however, I learned about <a href=\"https://github.com/tosterkamp/random-redirect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this software</a> which randomly redirects users to publicly hosted instances of open-source software platforms. If you use CryptPad as a place to collaborate rather than a place to store documents, then you could try <a href=\"https://cryptpad.random-redirect.de/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cryptpad.random-redirect.de</a> to find alternatives. If you host a CryptPad instance you could even inquire about adding your server to the list. One of the great things about open-source software is that failures that affect one server or service do not need to have global effects.</p>\n<p>Despite the positive aspects of our community’s response to this event, I regret that it took so long migrate to a new machine. The simple fact is that while we (mostly Kevin and Ludovic) have put in a lot of effort to making sure that our hosting infrastructure is reliable, we were unprepared for the task of rapidly migrating our entire database to a new machine. We’re hosting about six times more data now than we were at the start of the year. Until now we’ve had little cause to consider the increasing difficulty of managing this growing dataset and with everything else that has happened this year there has been little opportunity to do so. This event made it abundantly clear that we’re going to have to find the required time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we-plan-to-do\"><a href=\"#What-we-plan-to-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we plan to do\"></a>What we plan to do</h2><p>It would be an understatement to say that I have a bit of an idealist stance when it comes to software. This is why I work on open-source, privacy-preserving tech. It’s terrible that modern, web-based software is as fragile as it is. That said, the alternative of emailing static documents to colleagues (or between devices) also makes it difficult to be productive.</p>\n<p>It’s a bit ridiculous that a broken cooling system in northern France can mean that our 20,000 daily active users lose the ability to edit or even read their documents for more than a day. More frustrating is the fact that we were very nearly in a good position to mitigate many of the adverse effects of this outage. We’ve been working on some new <em>offline-first</em> functionality in CryptPad over the last few months and, as noted above, we were considering deploying the first phase of these improvements the day of the outage.</p>\n<p>Our first offline features were deployed yesterday as a part of our <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/3.25.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">3.25.0 release</a>. Now, every time you load a document in CryptPad you’re also populating an advanced cache in your browser. For now this only has the effect of reducing the total time to load cached documents, since we still wait for confirmation from the server that this is the most recent version of the content before removing the loading screen.</p>\n<p>Our next step will be to merge a branch of our code which will instead load and display the last known state of any document in your local cache in offline mode, regardless of whether you’re able to reach our database server. This would have alleviated some of the inconvenience of our outage, since users were still able to load the platform’s HTML and JavaScript that would have at least let them access cached documents.</p>\n<p>The next major feature will be the use of <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">service-workers</a> to enable browsers to use very advanced caching policies and load our client-side code even while entirely offline, allowing full access to cached documents under almost any circumstance. We expect to deploy these updates in early January 2021 as a part of our upcoming <em>4.0.0</em> release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/paper/grayfailure-hotos17.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One of my favourite academic papers</a> defines the term <strong>gray failures</strong>, in which well-intentioned attempts to introduce redundancy into online systems can paradoxically increases the likelihood of service degradation or interruptions. In the last few weeks both Amazon and Google (some of the richest companies on the planet, in case you haven’t heard of them) have experienced severe service outages. There are very few easy answers in this area, but we’re going to learn from this situation and work on solutions that would have helped at least let us recover more quickly.</p>\n<p>If the next data-center failure happens in another three years I hope it will only last a small fraction of the time, and that our software will be so resilient you’ll hardly notice. In the meantime our team greatly appreciates all your support!</p>\n"},{"title":"August 2021 status: Forms hackathon and a new social media account","date":"2021-08-26T07:55:32.000Z","author":"David Benqué","_content":"\n\nThis month the team has been operating at reduced capacity as we took turns taking much needed breaks.

From a user perspective, these two releases bring some major new functionality in the form of a calendar app. We have also made some improvements for instance administrators by introducing instance-wide \"broadcasts\". Finally there are some exciting things on the horizon as we have secured funding for a new research project. \n\n## Calendar\n\nThe new calendar app made its debut as a [BETA preview](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad/106064064521575394) in 4.4.0 and will be fully released in 4.5.0. This application is not directly funded by any of our current research projects, but rather makes the most out of the [Dialogue project](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/) funded by NLNet/NGI Zero. For Dialogue, we have planned a full re-write of our current Polls app as well as a new Survey app (see [our roadmap](https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/) for more details). Both of these include a **Reminders API** to notify authors, for example when surveys are completed. Rather than limit this API to the upcoming apps, we took this as an opportunity to bring full calendar functionality to CryptPad. When it is released, the calendar app will include the following features: \n\n- Creation of calendars and events for CryptPad users and teams.\n- A typical calendar UI with month, week, and day views, drag and \"resize\" events, etc thanks to [Toast UI](https://ui.toast.com/tui-calendar).\n- Sharing calendars similarly to any other CryptPad document (access rights, sharing with contacts, via a link, etc).\n- Import/Export of .ics files for interoperability with other calendar apps.\n- Setting reminders for events, and receiving reminders as CryptPad notifications.\n\n![A beta preview of the calendar application](/images/BETA-calendar-preview.png)\n\nWe are aware that some features are missing, such as recurring events. This is likely to generate some \"feature request\" messages from users that we will have no funded time to address. However our hope is that this initial feature set still brings enough benefits to CryptPad users on the whole to make it worthwhile. \n\n## Admin Broadcasts\n\nAnother part of the Dialogue project is to enable administrators to **broadcast** messages to all users on their instance. This is now possible as of version 4.4.0, with the following use-cases available in the Broadcast tab of the Administration panel: \n\n- **Maintenance**: to notify users of planned work that may disturb their use of the platform. Admins enter a start and end time and users receive notifications prior and during the planned maintenance.\n- **Survey**: to direct users to a survey via an external link. Admins enter the survey URL and users receive a notification and a survey link in the user menu. Users of [cryptpad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) can make use of this with our new survey to gather feedback on their usage.\n- **Custom message**: to send any message as a notification to all instance users. The message can be translated in all languages available on CryptPad, and will be seen by new users registering as long as it remains active. \n\nInstance administrators are set to receive more support as we wrap up our [Communities](https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad-Communities/) project. The last of our 3 documentation guides will cover instance installation and administration, and the only remaining feature of the project will allow admins to restrict registration on their instance.\n\nWhile we are on the topic of administration, we have added [one line](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/commit/4d5d809447130710728ea85caf53c38f084ebb26) to the [example Nginx configuration](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/blob/main/docs/example.nginx.conf) for CryptPad.\n\n```diff\n+ add_header Permissions-Policy interest-cohort=();\n```\n\nThis opts the instance out of [Google's FLoC network](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea), we encourage all administrators to make this change. \n\n## INTEROFFICE for DAPSI \n\nFinally, we are delighted to announce that we have secured €100K in funding from the [NGI Data Portability & Services Incubator](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/) (DAPSI). Our project is called INTEROFFICE: INTER-operable Office File Formats Integrated with Client-side Encryption.\n\nOur focus in this project will be to develop solutions for converting documents to/from popular office formats (.xlsx, .docx, .odt, .csv, etc). There are, of course, already solutions to this problem but none that operate solely *in the browser* which makes them unsuitable for CryptPad. Our experience with .xslx import/export in CryptPad Sheets has been useful to us in scoping out this space, and in confirming how lacking it currently is. Our goal with INTEROFFICE is to bring multi-format document conversions to the client, and to CryptPad, which we hope will: \n\n- Address a common barrier to the adoption of CryptPad (unsupported office formats).\n- Make it easier for users to retain local copies of their documents, integrate them in broader office workflows, or simply leave the platform with their data. \n- Make CryptPad more versatile and useful.\n- Make it easier for anyone else working in this space to do client-side document conversions since we plan to release this work as open-source modules.\n\nWe are excited to start work on this, and will use future monthly status posts to keep everyone updated on progress. \n","source":"_posts/status-april-2021.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"April 2021 status: Calendars and a major new research project\"\ndate: 2021-04-26 14:05:43\nauthor: David Benqué\ntags:\n  - status update\n  - calendar\n  - administration\n  - research\n  - funding\n---\n\n\nThis month we released CryptPad [4.4.0](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/4.4.0), and 4.5.0 is just around the corner.

mess","date":"2019-06-14T11:59:33.000Z","author":"Aaron MacSween","_content":"\nNormally when I write a blog post it's because I have exciting news to share.\nThis time it's not a fun occasion because the only good news I have is that the bad news isn't permanent.\n\nThe bad news is that during some database maintenance yesterday (June 13th) I accidentally removed some of the data from users' encrypted drives.\nThe good news is that these files were archived, not deleted, and that everything can be recovered.\n\nBefore I get into the details of why this happened I'd like to clarify which user data was archived and how to check if your account was one of those affected.\n\n## How to tell if you were affected\n\nFirst off, everything is related to my actions administrating the database of [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr).\nUsers of other instances have nothing to worry about unless their administrator did the exact same thing as I did, which is unlikely.\n\nSecondly, the issue is limited to shared folders and non-owned files contained within them.\nIf you don't use shared folders you won't be affected.\n\nThirdly, as far as we can tell you need to have visited CryptPad.fr between May 28th and June 13th in order to have run some incorrect code.\n\nFinally, nothing was archived unless it had not been active within the preceding 90 days.\nIn the case of shared folders, this would mean any change to the content or structure of the shared folder, such as adding or removing a document or renaming or moving any of its contents.\nIn the case of pads, if a user with the rights to edit the document loaded it without making any changes, that would classify it as active.\n\nTo summarise:\n\nSome of your data could have been archived if you visited https://CryptPad.fr between May 28th and June 13th (2019) and have one or more shared folders in your CryptDrive which have not been modified within the last 90 days.\n\n## Checking if you were affected\n\nIt should be fairly easy to tell if your account was affected by opening your CryptDrive.\nAffected shared folders will be visible in the tree on the left of your drive because they'll have lost their titles, as highlighted in red below:\n\n![archived shared folders](/images/archived-shared-folder-appearance.png)\n\n## How we're going to handle this\n\nAs I said, none of the data was deleted, just archived.\nIt's still on the same server that hosts the rest of our database, it's just been moved to a different location to make it inaccessible.\n\nI've already restored all of those files which were archived except for 237 cases.\nAffected Users that visited CryptPad.fr between the removal and restoration of the data would have automatically created a new folder in the same location as the old one, and that complicates things for us.\nSince we don't know whether they might have decided to put new documents in that folder in the meantime, it's dangerous for us to overwrite the new data with the old.\n\nIt's going to take us a few days to figure out if we can use some fancier methodology to identify what data we can safely reinstate.\nIn the meantime, we've already fixed the underlying issues that caused this data to be miscategorized, and developed some new tooling for safely diagnosing and restoring archived data.\n\nSince we know that those affected by this error visited since our last release day and that they had content older than 90 days, we assume they're going to come back to the platform.\nIf you do come back and see something resembling the image above, please do let us know by emailing us at contact@cryptpad.fr.\nWe can manually restore any files that haven't already been restored.\n\nI'm very sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused and I'm grateful that the damage wasn't worse.\nI'll take this as an opportunity to prove my commitment to protecting user data, whether it be from surveillance or from my own mistakes.\n\n## Post-mortem\n\nWith all the practical details addressed for those who only have the time to make sure their own data is safe, I'll go further into the specifics for anyone who might be interested.\n\n### The pinning race condition (May 28th)\n\nOn May 28th we released [CryptPad _Xenops_](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/2.23.0).\nIt introduced notifications for users through the use of something we've been calling \"encrypted mailboxes\".\nEach registered user now has a mailbox through which any other user can send messages, currently for friend requests, and soon for other features.\n\nWhile we were implementing the function which loads new messages from this mailbox we introduced a bug which caused some other functions to be executed in the wrong order.\nI personally reviewed the code but didn't see the bug.\n\nRegistered users are able to send instructions to the server not to delete data that is relevant to them.\nWe call this process _\"pinning\"_ and it's done every time a user uses the service.\n\nWhat should have happened is that users should have loaded their drive, then loaded their shared folders, then pinned all the contained files.\nInstead, they loaded their drive and then started loading their shared folders and started the pinning process in parallel.\nThis caused what's called a race condition, which means that two things happen at the same time, and sometimes they happen in different orders.\n\nRace conditions are especially annoying because sometimes they only occur under certain circumstances, so these bugs tend to slip past basic testing unless you already know what you're looking for.\nIn our case, losing the race meant that files weren't pinned and consequently the server didn't have an accurate notion of which data was worth keeping.\n\n### Running out of space (June 3rd)\n\nSeveral months ago a user contacted us saying that data had disappeared from their drive.\nThis was quite scary from our perspective as for every user that contacts us about something we can generally assume that there are many more that had the same issue, but didn't say anything.\n\nWe spent several days debugging their problem and developing tools which would analyze the history of their drive without exposing any of their encrypted content to us.\nIn the end, it turned out that the files didn't ever exist in their history, so it wasn't a matter of us losing that data.\nNevertheless, the situation was stressful enough that we turned off all of our scripts for deleting inactive data until we could sort out a more reliable methodology for handling data.\n\nWith that regular process not in place, and with increasingly more users visiting our service, our database continued to grow at an accellerating pace.\nOn June 3rd we started receiving automated emails from XWiki's infrastructure services that we were down to 20% of our disk space.\nWe had been meaning to handle this problem for some time but with 33 emails arriving in our inboxes each day we finally decided to prioritize it.\n\n### Replaced the race condition (June 6th)\n\nAfter the _Xenops_ release we noticed an error that was occurring in our browser consoles fairly regularly and decided to debug it.\nWe tracked it down and fixed it, but since we weren't looking for the other race condition described above, we managed to change the code in such a way that a functionally identical race condition was still present.\nWe fixed one issue, but pads still weren't being pinned reliably.\n\n### Incorrect data archival (June 13th)\n\nHaving proceeded with fixing a variety of other bugs, I turned my attention back to solving our storage issue.\nDeleting data hadn't become any less scary than it had always been so I proceeded with caution, implementing an archival system that would move inactive data to what we termed _\"cold storage\"_ for a set period before removing it permanently.\n\nI implemented some code for iterating over our complete database and used that to create a script for checking the most recent modifications to user data.\nI read through it a number of times, tested it on my local database and had my colleague review it and test it on his machine.\nBefore using it on our production database I made sure to also write and test a script that would restore archived files in case anything went wrong.\n\nI think I must have sat in front of my laptop and stared at my screen for between five and ten minutes before I hit enter on the command to run the script.\nI had the code for the script on another monitor, and I double-checked it before deciding to proceed.\nI reloaded my drive to make sure everything was still there once it finished running, and it was.\nAfter twenty minutes or so of testing everything seemed alright, so I went on with my day.\n\nLater on we finally noticed that there was a problem with one of our user accounts, specifically with a shared folder having disappeared.\nWe stayed at the office late into the evening to figure out what had happened, and ended up tracking the problem to the pinning logic before deciding to follow up on it in the morning.\n\n### Final debugging and restoration (June 14th)\n\nWith as restful a night as I could manage under the circumstances, I came back to the office this morning with a bit of perspective on the issue.\nI wrote up a pad which collected all the information we had into one place, identifying the circumstances under which we believed the problem could occur.\n\nI reviewed the script which restored archived files, making sure that it would not overwrite any user data if utilized.\nMy colleague implemented a fix for the race condition which contributed to the pinning issue, which I deployed as soon as I could review it.\n\nAfter writing a few more scripts I was able to determine the number of shared folders which had been replaced with conflicting entries with the same identifiers (237).\nKnowing this number allowed me to determine how to handle the issue.\nIf the number was significantly smaller it might have been easier to handle, but the order of magnitude is such that we'll have to figure out an automated way to deal with the issue or else spend the next few weeks responding to emails and manually recovering files.\n\nWith a better grasp on the situation and with some confidence that it wasn't the database processing scripts which were incorrect, I restored the archived files with the exception of those which conflicted with the production database.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIf I've learned anything in my time working on CryptPad it's that I should appreciate the reasons why the majority of the software industry doesn't work with encrypted database as we do.\nEven on a good day it can be a harder job than it would otherwise be.\nOn a day like today we end up having to reason with what the clientside code would have done under various circumstances and think about what information we can access.\n\nIn any case, I'm very happy that we decided to turn off our deletion scripts months ago.\nHad they still been active, this relatively mild pinning and archival bug would have resulted in data loss.\n\nWhile we can tell that 237 shared folders were affected, we still have to think about how the absence of that data would be handled by the code for user's CryptDrives.\nTo further complicate things, we have to think beyond what our code would do and into what users might have done in reaction to what they saw.\nIf they saw and removed the now-empty shared folders in their drive, they no longer have the encryption keys to decrypt them even though we've now restored the underlying data.\nBecause we've spent so much time trying to protect our users' privacy we can't actually ascertain if they've interacted with this part of their drive at all.\n\nOn one hand, it makes my life that much more stressful to have to figure out the answers to these problems.\nOn the other, I'm hopeful that by doing this work now I'll help pave the way for more developers to create services which offer similar protection for their users' data.\n\nAs stated above, if this particular mistake affected you, don't hesitate to contact us.\nOtherwise, I can only hope that the way we handle it ensures that you continue to trust us with your data.\n\n","source":"_posts/Yesterday-I-made-a-mess.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Yesterday I made a mess\ndate: 2019-06-14 17:29:33\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  - cloud\n  - storage\n  - data\n---\n\nNormally when I write a blog post it's because I have exciting news to share.\nThis time it's not a fun occasion because the only good news I have is that the bad news isn't permanent.\n\nThe bad news is that during some database maintenance yesterday (June 13th) I accidentally removed some of the data from users' encrypted drives.\nThe good news is that these files were archived, not deleted, and that everything can be recovered.\n\nBefore I get into the details of why this happened I'd like to clarify which user data was archived and how to check if your account was one of those affected.\n\n## How to tell if you were affected\n\nFirst off, everything is related to my actions administrating the database of [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr).\nUsers of other instances have nothing to worry about unless their administrator did the exact same thing as I did, which is unlikely.\n\nSecondly, the issue is limited to shared folders and non-owned files contained within them.\nIf you don't use shared folders you won't be affected.\n\nThirdly, as far as we can tell you need to have visited CryptPad.fr between May 28th and June 13th in order to have run some incorrect code.\n\nFinally, nothing was archived unless it had not been active within the preceding 90 days.\nIn the case of shared folders, this would mean any change to the content or structure of the shared folder, such as adding or removing a document or renaming or moving any of its contents.\nIn the case of pads, if a user with the rights to edit the document loaded it without making any changes, that would classify it as active.\n\nTo summarise:\n\nSome of your data could have been archived if you visited https://CryptPad.fr between May 28th and June 13th (2019) and have one or more shared folders in your CryptDrive which have not been modified within the last 90 days.\n\n## Checking if you were affected\n\nIt should be fairly easy to tell if your account was affected by opening your CryptDrive.\nAffected shared folders will be visible in the tree on the left of your drive because they'll have lost their titles, as highlighted in red below:\n\n![archived shared folders](/images/archived-shared-folder-appearance.png)\n\n## How we're going to handle this\n\nAs I said, none of the data was deleted, just archived.\nIt's still on the same server that hosts the rest of our database, it's just been moved to a different location to make it inaccessible.\n\nI've already restored all of those files which were archived except for 237 cases.\nAffected Users that visited CryptPad.fr between the removal and restoration of the data would have automatically created a new folder in the same location as the old one, and that complicates things for us.\nSince we don't know whether they might have decided to put new documents in that folder in the meantime, it's dangerous for us to overwrite the new data with the old.\n\nIt's going to take us a few days to figure out if we can use some fancier methodology to identify what data we can safely reinstate.\nIn the meantime, we've already fixed the underlying issues that caused this data to be miscategorized, and developed some new tooling for safely diagnosing and restoring archived data.\n\nSince we know that those affected by this error visited since our last release day and that they had content older than 90 days, we assume they're going to come back to the platform.\nIf you do come back and see something resembling the image above, please do let us know by emailing us at contact@cryptpad.fr.\nWe can manually restore any files that haven't already been restored.\n\nI'm very sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused and I'm grateful that the damage wasn't worse.\nI'll take this as an opportunity to prove my commitment to protecting user data, whether it be from surveillance or from my own mistakes.\n\n## Post-mortem\n\nWith all the practical details addressed for those who only have the time to make sure their own data is safe, I'll go further into the specifics for anyone who might be interested.\n\n### The pinning race condition (May 28th)\n\nOn May 28th we released [CryptPad _Xenops_](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/2.23.0).\nIt introduced notifications for users through the use of something we've been calling \"encrypted mailboxes\".\nEach registered user now has a mailbox through which any other user can send messages, currently for friend requests, and soon for other features.\n\nWhile we were implementing the function which loads new messages from this mailbox we introduced a bug which caused some other functions to be executed in the wrong order.\nI personally reviewed the code but didn't see the bug.\n\nRegistered users are able to send instructions to the server not to delete data that is relevant to them.\nWe call this process _\"pinning\"_ and it's done every time a user uses the service.\n\nWhat should have happened is

have is that the bad news isn’t permanent.</p>\n<p>The bad news is that during some database maintenance yesterday (June 13th) I accidentally removed some of the data from users’ encrypted drives.\nThe good news is that these files were archived, not deleted, and that everything can be recovered.</p>\n<p>Before I get into the details of why this happened I’d like to clarify which user data was archived and how to check if your account was one of those affected.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-tell-if-you-were-affected\"><a href=\"#How-to-tell-if-you-were-affected\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to tell if you were affected\"></a>How to tell if you were affected</h2><p>First off, everything is related to my actions administrating the database of <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CryptPad.fr</a>.\nUsers of other instances have nothing to worry about unless their administrator did the exact same thing as I did, which is unlikely.</p>\n<p>Secondly, the issue is limited to shared folders and non-owned files contained within them.\nIf you don’t use shared folders you won’t be affected.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, as far as we can tell you need to have visited CryptPad.fr between May 28th and June 13th in order to have run some incorrect code.</p>\n<p>Finally, nothing was archived unless it had not been active within the preceding 90 days.\nIn the case of shared folders, this would mean any change to the content or structure of the shared folder, such as adding or removing a document or renaming or moving any of its contents.\nIn the case of pads, if a user with the rights to edit the document loaded it without making any changes, that would classify it as active.</p>\n<p>To summarise:</p>\n<p>Some of your data could have been archived if you visited <a href=\"https://CryptPad.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://CryptPad.fr</a> between May 28th and June 13th (2019) and have one or more shared folders in your CryptDrive which have not been modified within the last 90 days.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Checking-if-you-were-affected\"><a href=\"#Checking-if-you-were-affected\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Checking if you were affected\"></a>Checking if you were affected</h2><p>It should be fairly easy to tell if your account was affected by opening your CryptDrive.\nAffected shared folders will be visible in the tree on the left of your drive because they’ll have lost their titles, as highlighted in red below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/archived-shared-folder-appearance.png\" alt=\"archived shared folders\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"How-we’re-going-to-handle-this\"><a href=\"#How-we’re-going-to-handle-this\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How we’re going to handle this\"></a>How we’re going to handle this</h2><p>As I said, none of the data was deleted, just archived.\nIt’s still on the same server that hosts the rest of our database, it’s just been moved to a different location to make it inaccessible.</p>\n<p>I’ve already restored all of those files which were archived except for 237 cases.\nAffected Users that visited CryptPad.fr between the removal and restoration of the data would have automatically created a new folder in the same location as the old one, and that complicates things for us.\nSince we don’t know whether they might have decided to put new documents in that folder in the meantime, it’s dangerous for us to overwrite the new data with the old.</p>\n<p>It’s going to take us a few days to figure out if we can use some fancier methodology to identify what data we can safely reinstate.\nIn the meantime, we’ve already fixed the underlying issues that caused this data to be miscategorized, and developed some new tooling for safely diagnosing and restoring archived data.</p>\n<p>Since we know that those affected by this error visited since our last release day and that they had content older than 90 days, we assume they’re going to come back to the platform.\nIf you do come back and see something resembling the image above, please do let us know by emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:contact@cryptpad.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">contact@cryptpad.fr</a>.\nWe can manually restore any files that haven’t already been restored.</p>\n<p>I’m very sorry for any inconvenience this might have caused and I’m grateful that the damage wasn’t worse.\nI’ll take this as an opportunity to prove my commitment to protecting user data, whether it be from surveillance or from my own mistakes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Post-mortem\"><a href=\"#Post-mortem\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Post-mortem\"></a>Post-mortem</h2><p>With all the practical details addressed for those who only have the time to make sure their own data is safe, I’ll go further into the specifics for anyone who might be interested.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-pinning-race-condition-May-28th\"><a href=\"#The-pinning-race-condition-May-28th\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The pinning race condition (May 28th)\"></a>The pinning race condition (May 28th)</h3><p>On May 28th we released <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/2.23.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CryptPad <em>Xenops</em></a>.\nIt introduced notifications for users through the use of something we’ve been calling “encrypted mailboxes”.\nEach registered user now has a mailbox through which any other user can send messages, currently for friend requests, and soon for other features.</p>\n<p>While we were implementing the function which loads new messages from this mailbox we introduced a bug which caused some other functions to be executed in the wrong order.\nI personally reviewed the code but didn’t see the bug.</p>\n<p>Registered users are able to send instructions to the server not to delete data that is relevant to them.\nWe call this process <em>“pinning”</em> and it’s done every time a user uses the service.</p>\n<p>What should have happened is that users should have loaded their drive, then loaded their shared folders, then pinned all the contained files.\nInstead, they loaded their drive and then started loading their shared folders and started the pinning process in parallel.\nThis caused what’s called a race condition, which means that two things happen at the same time, and sometimes they happen in different orders.</p>\n<p>Race conditions are especially annoying because sometimes they only occur under certain circumstances, so these bugs tend to slip past basic testing unless you already know what you’re looking for.\nIn our case, losing the race meant that files weren’t pinned and consequently the server didn’t have an accurate notion of which data was worth keeping.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Running-out-of-space-June-3rd\"><a href=\"#Running-out-of-space-June-3rd\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Running out of space (June 3rd)\"></a>Running out of space (June 3rd)</h3><p>Several months ago a user contacted us saying that data had disappeared from their drive.\nThis was quite scary from our perspective as for every user that contacts us about something we can generally assume that there are many more that had the same issue, but didn’t say anything.</p>\n<p>We spent several days debugging their problem and developing tools which would analyze the history of their drive without exposing any of their encrypted content to us.\nIn the end, it turned out that the files didn’t ever exist in their history, so it wasn’t a matter of us losing that data.\nNevertheless, the situation was stressful enough that we turned off all of our scripts for deleting inactive data until we could sort out a more reliable methodology for handling data.</p>\n<p>With that regular process not in place, and with increasingly more users visiting our service, our database continued to grow at an accellerating pace.\nOn June 3rd we started receiving automated emails from XWiki’s infrastructure services that we were down to 20% of our disk space.\nWe had been meaning to handle this problem for some time but with 33 emails arriving in our inboxes each day we finally decided to prioritize it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Replaced-the-race-condition-June-6th\"><a href=\"#Replaced-the-race-condition-June-6th\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Replaced the race condition (June 6th)\"></a>Replaced the race condition (June 6th)</h3><p>After the <em>Xenops</em> release we noticed an error that was occurring in our browser consoles fairly regularly and decided to debug it.\nWe tracked it down and fixed it, but since we weren’t looking for the other race condition described above, we managed to change the code in such a way that a functionally identical race condition was still present.\nWe fixed one issue, but pads still weren’t being pinned reliably.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Incorrect-data-archival-June-13th\"><a href=\"#Incorrect-data-archival-June-13th\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Incorrect data archival (June 13th)\"></a>Incorrect data archival (June 13th)</h3><p>Having proceeded with fixing a variety of other bugs, I turned my attention back to solving our storage issue.\nDeleting data hadn’t become any less scary than it had always been so I proceeded with caution, implementing an archival system that would move inactive data to what we termed <em>“cold storage”</em> for a set period before removing it permanently.</p>\n<p>I implemented some code for iterating over our complete database and used that to create a script for checking the most recent modifications to user data.\nI read through it a number of times, tested it on my local database and had my colleague review it and test it on his machine.\nBefore using it on our production database I made sure to also write and test a script that would restore archived files in case anything went wrong.</p>\n<p>I think I must have sat in front of my laptop and stared at my screen for between five and ten minutes before I hit enter on the command to run the script.\nI had the code for the script on another monitor, and I double-checked it before deciding to proceed.\nI reloaded my drive to make sure everything was still there once it finished running, and it was.\nAfter twenty minutes or so of testing everything seemed alright, so I went on with my day.</p>\n<p>Later on we finally noticed that there was a problem with one of our user accounts, specifically with a shared folder having disappeared.\nWe stayed at the office late into the evening to figure out what had happened, and ended up tracking the problem to the pinning logic before deciding to follow up on it in the morning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Final-debugging-and-restoration-June-14th\"><a href=\"#Final-debugging-and-restoration-June-14th\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Final debugging and restoration (June 14th)\"></a>Final debugging and restoration (June 14th)</h3><p>With as restful a night as I could manage under the circumstances, I came back to the office this morning with a bit of perspective on the issue.\nI wrote up a pad which collected all the information we had into one place, identifying the circumstances under which we believed the problem could occur.</p>\n<p>I reviewed the script which restored archived files, making sure that it would not overwrite any user data if utilized.\nMy colleague implemented a fix for the race condition which contributed to the pinning issue, which I deployed as soon as I could review it.</p>\n<p>After writing a few more scripts I was able to determine the number of shared folders which had been replaced with conflicting entries with the same identifiers (237).\nKnowing this number allowed me to determine how to handle the issue.\nIf the number was significantly smaller it might have been easier to handle, but the order of magnitude is such that we’ll have to figure out an automated way to deal with the issue or else spend the next few weeks responding to emails and manually recovering files.</p>\n<p>With a better grasp on the situation and with some confidence that it wasn’t the database processing scripts which were incorrect, I restored the archived files with the exception of those which conflicted with the production database.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a href=\"#Conclusion\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If I’ve learned anything in my time working on CryptPad it’s that I should appreciate the reasons why the majority of the software industry doesn’t work with encrypted database as we do.\nEven on a good day it can be a harder job than it would otherwise be.\nOn a day like today we end up having to reason with what the clientside code would have done under various circumstances and think about what information we can access.</p>\n<p>In any case, I’m very happy that we decided to turn off our deletion scripts months ago.\nHad they still been active, this relatively mild pinning and archival bug would have resulted in data loss.</p>\n<p>While we can tell that 237 shared folders were affected, we still have to think about how the absence of that data would be handled by the code for user’s CryptDrives.\nTo further complicate things, we have to think beyond what our code would do and into what users might have done in reaction to what they saw.\nIf they saw and removed the now-empty shared folders in their drive, they no longer have the encryption keys to decrypt them even though we’ve now restored the underlying data.\nBecause we’ve spent so much time trying to protect our users’ privacy we can’t actually ascertain if they’ve interacted with this part of their drive at all.</p>\n<p>On one hand, it makes my life that much more stressful to have to figure out the answers to these problems.\nOn the other, I’m hopeful that by doing this work now I’ll help pave the way for more developers to create services which offer similar protection for their users’ data.</p>\n<p>As stated above, if this particular mistake affected you, don’t hesitate to contact us.\nOtherwise, I can only hope that the way we handle it ensures that you continue to trust us with your data.</p>\n"},{"title":"Feb. 2021 status: Dark mode and organisation plans","date":"2021-02-24T06:27:52.000Z","author":"David Benqué","_content":"\nThis is a new format of post we are starting on the blog: publishing the monthly updates that were until now only circulated in the internal XWiki newsletter. This will be an opportunity to regularly catch up on new features, research projects, funding/budget updates, and any other relevant news.\n\n## FOSDEM presentations\n\nAaron and David presented different aspects of CryptPad at FOSDEM 2021. Please see the [updated blog post](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/02/03/CryptPad-at-FOSDEM-2021/) for videos of both presentations.\n\n## Dark mode\n\nThis month we followed up on the rebranding started with version 4.0 by thoroughly refactoring how styles, especially colors, are applied across CryptPad. This allows for better maintainance and easier customisation. The first custom theme is the long requested **dark mode**.\n\nCryptPad will now follow the browser or operating system preference by default, and switch to a dark theme accordingly. The theme can also be set manually in Settings > Appearance.\n\n![The CryptDrive in dark mode](/images/dark-drive.png)\n\nFollowing the introduction of the dark theme in our 4.2 release, we noticed a few problems and got to work on correcting them. The most noticeable issue was the use of a dark background for rich text documents. Wanting to offer a \"true\" dark mode, we had intially switched the editor itself to a dark background, and made the default text color contrast with that automatically. It soon became apparent that this was a problematic choice in rich text documents where users are able to set colors for text. It may lead to text being un-readable depending on the theme used. One particularly painful example was a document about making web content accessible written in black text on a dark background. We reverted our decision and opted for a light background in the editor even when the rest of the interface is dark. There is a reason mainstream editors such as Microsoft Word do it this way. You can expect more polish on the dark theme in the upcoming 4.3 release.\n\n![Web accessibility guide shown with black text on a dark background](/images/dark-shame.png)\n\n*The web content accessibility guide that prompted us to revert our decision on the dark theme rich text editor. [The guide](https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/nOPkDL0nzbEi1DXnpEED0nqORBPF6pqS3SOUrKBqV9o/embed/) is by AccessiBloc.*\n\n\n## Organization plans\n\nOn cryptpad.fr, another long-awaited feature were the **Organization plans**. We have been communicating this pricing on request for the last few months but the plans are now [live in the cryptpad.fr interface](https://cryptpad.fr/accounts/#org). These bigger plans have the additional option to download a personalised signed Data Processing Agreement (DPA) for organsations that need to demonstrate they operate according to the GDPR.\n\nThese plans come with 1 business day support and increased storage shared between a number of user accounts, priced as follows: \n\n- **25 Users** with 100GB of storage for 500€ a year (ex. VAT)\n- **100 Users** with 150GB of storage for 1000€ a year (ex. VAT)\n\nAn additional On Premises option is available for organizations that require their own CryptPad instance, with installation and maintainance support by the development team. \n\nWe were happy to welcome the first couple of subscribers on these plans and hope that they will contribute to making CryptPad financially sustainable in the longer term.\n\n![The new organization plans on cryptpad.fr in dark mode.](/images/dark-accounts.png)\n\n\n## A popular toolkit\n\nWe had an unexpected spike in traffic early in the month after the following tweet linked to a toolkit made on cryptpad.fr.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here’s an updated toolkit by people on the ground in India if you want to help.

While this was a surprise, our infrastructure was prepared for it and held up very well.\n\n![graph showing a big spike in visits to CryptPad.fr](/images/greta-stonks.png)\n\n## Delivered: NGI Trust project: Secure Mobile Collaboration\n\nWe have wrapped up this exploratory project about using CryptPad on mobile devices. There will be dedicated posts about this project in the near future. This project allowed us to scope out, in depth, the options available to make CryptPad work as an \"app\". As a summary of our findings, here is what we plan to include in the new Frequently Asked Questions section of our documentation that will be part of the next release: \n\n---\n\n### FAQ: Are you planning a mobile app? \n\nWe are not planning a dedicated mobile application for the following reasons:\n- It would dramatically increase the amount of code that has to be developed and maintained, effectively creating other \"versions\" of CryptPad for iOS and Android.\n- CryptPad is open source and can be hosted by anyone who wants to offer the service. Therefore, users of a mobile application would have to specify which CryptPad instance they want to connect to, which would be confusing. To complicate things further, each instance may be running a different version of the software, depending on whether or not the latest updates were applied by the administrators.  \n\nTo address these problems, the development team is working on making CryptPad a \"Progressive Web App\". This means that it can be used on mobile through the web browser, behaving like an application while being the same software that runs on desktop browsers. This has the benefit of turning every CryptPad instance into a web app provider, rather than putting the burden of choosing the right instance on the user.\n\n---\n\nThis approach has already started to inform new developments for CryptPad, for example the use of IndexedDB for caching documents which is already deployed. Further improvements will follow, including a full \"offline\" mode. \n\n\nThis wraps up our first monthly status post. In March we will be shifting back to our NLNet Communities project and attempt to finish the outstanding deliverables around documentation for developers and instance administrators. \n\n","source":"_posts/status-feb-2021.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"Feb. 2021 status: Dark mode and organisation plans\"\ndate: 2021-02-24 11:57:52\nauthor: David Benqué\ntags:\n  - status update\n---\n\nThis is a new format of post we are starting on the blog: publishing the monthly updates that were until now only circulated in the internal XWiki newsletter.

This allows for better maintainance and easier customisation. The first custom theme is the long requested <strong>dark mode</strong>.</p>\n<p>CryptPad will now follow the browser or operating system preference by default, and switch to a dark theme accordingly. The theme can also be set manually in Settings &gt; Appearance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/dark-drive.png\" alt=\"The CryptDrive in dark mode\"></p>\n<p>Following the introduction of the dark theme in our 4.2 release, we noticed a few problems and got to work on correcting them. The most noticeable issue was the use of a dark background for rich text documents. Wanting to offer a “true” dark mode, we had intially switched the editor itself to a dark background, and made the default text color contrast with that automatically. It soon became apparent that this was a problematic choice in rich text documents where users are able to set colors for text. It may lead to text being un-readable depending on the theme used. One particularly painful example was a document about making web content accessible written in black text on a dark background. We reverted our decision and opted for a light background in the editor even when the rest of the interface is dark. There is a reason mainstream editors such as Microsoft Word do it this way. You can expect more polish on the dark theme in the upcoming 4.3 release.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/dark-shame.png\" alt=\"Web accessibility guide shown with black text on a dark background\"></p>\n<p><em>The web content accessibility guide that prompted us to revert our decision on the dark theme rich text editor. <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/pad/#/2/pad/view/nOPkDL0nzbEi1DXnpEED0nqORBPF6pqS3SOUrKBqV9o/embed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The guide</a> is by AccessiBloc.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"Organization-plans\"><a href=\"#Organization-plans\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Organization plans\"></a>Organization plans</h2><p>On cryptpad.fr, another long-awaited feature were the <strong>Organization plans</strong>.

There are four\ntypes of information:\n\n* What we can't know: This is data that CryptPad app encrypts so we will never have\naccess to it\n* What we must see but don't collect: This is information which we don't bother\nto store but because of how the technology works, we necessarily have access to it.\n* What we must know: This is metadata which we cannot help but see because of the\nway the technology works\n* What we want to know: This is information which we really want to know in order\nto make CryptPad better every day\n\nWe want to know everything about *people*, we want to know how *people* use CryptPad,\nwhy *people* use CryptPad and how we can make their experience easier. However, we\ndon't want to know anything at all about *you*.\n\nThis poses a challenge because we want to collect as much aggregate information as we\ncan in order to make a great web service, but we don't want to collect data that can\nbe *linked* in order to tell a story about you.\n\n## What we can't know\n\nThere are a few things which the Zero Knowledge design of CryptPad does not allow\nus to know at all. These include (obviously) your password and the content of your\npads, but less obviously, the titles of your pads, the names of the contributors and\nyour username (you can even have the same username as someone else on the system, we\nwon't know). The types of your pads are also unknown to us though we could make\neducated guesses by looking at the encrypted data.\n\n*It is our promise to you that we will never collect this information.*\n\n## What we could know but don't bother to collect\n\nThere are also some things which we don't really want to know but we cannot avoid\nseeing it anyway. This includes most importantly the IP addresses of people who\nedited a specific pad. Technically we know your\n[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) because it's how you\ncommunicate with our server, but most of the actual operations are done using\ncommands sent down a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).\nOnce the WebSocket is established, we assign you a random ID and this is how\nyou are referenced, what appears in our server logs looks like this:\n\n```\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:20:47:45 +0200] \"GET /pad/ HTTP/1.1\"\n304 0 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109 Safari/537.36\" \"-\"\n```\n\nNotice there is no pad ID in there, the pad ID is not in the URL so it doesn't go\nin the server logs by default.\n\nCompare this with EtherPad:\n\n```\n  IP Address                                             Pad ID\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:11:54:37 -0700] \"GET /p/UNWnpczTkq HTTP/1.1\"\n200 8920 \"https://pad.meshwith.me/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X\n10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109\nSafari/537.36\"\n```\n\n*You cannot verify that we're not collecting this so best assume that we are.*\n\n## What we must know\n\nThere are some things which we need to know in order for CryptPad to function\nproperly, we need to know which pads are in your drive in order to impose\nstorage limits on logged-in users and to expire pads which nobody cares about.\nHowever, we don't know much about who you are. Since we don't know your username,\nto us you are identified by a public signing key, something like this:\n\n`YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A`\n\nWe know that `YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A` has 392 MB of data in\ntheir CryptDrive including a pad of some type which has the ID\n`fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390` and an uploaded which we know as\n`ff2fdf9bb99ecc89d29d780780de10efdac14ed15e93b235`. One of these pads that they\nhave is actually their drive itself, but we don't strictly know which one (again,\nwe can take guesses based on the size of the patches). You can find out what your\nsigning key is by looking at in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings).\n\nWe also know when each pad was last accessed so that we can know to delete pads\nwhich are not in anybody's CryptDrive and have not been opened in a long time.\n\n### Why we can't avoid collecting IP addresses\n\nBeing able to know how many *different* people are using CryptPad is very important\nto us. One rather rude person decided to try to crash our server by creating 647,533\npads. They didn't put much thought into their attack because what they were doing\nwas not actually creating pads, but it illustrates the problem that if we don't\nknow how many *different* people are using the server, we don't have any idea\nwhether we are popular or under attack. Worse, we don't know what features have\nwidespread support vs. which ones are only popular with a few prolific users.\n\nOne obvious thought is to simply run the IP addresses through a hash function the\nway we traditionally hash passwords. However this sadly cannot work because there\nare only 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses and constructing a\n[rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) to get back the\noriginal IP addresses would take only about 1 day of computer time. So in the end\nwe simply log the IP addresses and don't worry about it.\n\n### What a pad looks like to us\n\nA pad is stored as a file which represents a sequence of encrypted *patches*.\nThese patches change the content of the pad from nothing to whatever it becomes in\nthe end. A typical message looks something like this:\n```\n[0,\"69d46337f826c0ecd881be59c119a527\",\"MSG\",\"fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390\",\"51Q....\"]\n```\nIt starts with a zero and then your temporary random ID, then it contains the word\nMSG and the ID of the pad which it is sent to, this format is exactly the same as\nwhat is sent on the wire. Finally it contains the encrypted patch which tells us\nessentially nothing except it gives us a rough idea of just how big the change was.\n\nOccasionally the client will send a *checkpoint*, this is a special patch which\nremoves all of the content and then puts it all back again. To us, a checkpoint\nlooks the same as anything else, it is a big ball of encrypted data, except in this\ncase it is flagged as a checkpoint so the server knows it can send only part of\nthe history of the pad instead of all of it. However, they do give us a good idea\nof how big the pad actually is at that time.\n\n## What we collect because we want to know\n\nWhat we really want to understand is your *experience* with CryptPad and how we can\nmake that experience better. So therefore we collect quite a number of data-points\nabout where people click and what their browser supports. For example we collect\nthe dimensions of your browser. Not because we want to know who you are but because\nwe want to know that types of browsers we need to support.\n\n```\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:21:26:15 +0200]\n\"HEAD /common/feedback.html?DIMENSIONS:752x1440=1499369175085 HTTP/1.1\" 200 0\n\"https://cryptpad.fr/settings/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5)\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109 Safari/537.36\" \"-\"\n```\n\nYou can see an exhaustive list of things that we collect by checking out the\n[feedback functionality](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/search?p=2&q=Cryptpad.feedback&type=&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in the CryptPad source code but\nas of the time of this writing, we are collecting feedback about the following\nthings (usually we just collect the fact that an event occurred, not more).\n\n* Clicking \"upgrade account\"\n* Clicking \"support cryptpad\"\n* Presentation: clicking on \"print slides\"\n* Registering and logging in\n* Opening your recent pads as an anonymous user\n* Clicking any CKEditor button such as \"bold\" or \"italic\"\n* Displaying the drive as icons or as a list\n* Creating and using templates\n* Showing and hiding the userlist or CKEditor menu bar\n* Whether your browser is missing certain important features like\n[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy),\n[isArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray)\nor [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)\n* Which type of pad you are using\n* The dimensions of your browser window\n* When you have changed your display name\n* Whether you have migrated your CryptDrive from the legacy format\n\nIf you are worried about what we might do with this data, you can disable\nfeedback collection in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings/). But\nkeep in mind that if you disable it we cannot help but know, because your IP\naddress will be in the tiny minority of addresses which access the site but don't\nsend feedback messages.\n\n## What we can learn from the data\n\n\n### 1. People mostly use CryptPad to make a plain old pad\nBut the code/markdown pad and the CryptDrive are catching up.\n![Unique IPs per pad type](/images/Analytics-padtypes.png)\n\n### 2. Activity has been on a very slow rise but with a few spikes\nThis chart shows unique IPs per day hitting CryptPad. You can things are relatively\nflat over time except for a big day in June and then some increased activity in July\nafter the UI improvements were rolled out.\n![Unique IPs per day](/images/Analytics-uniques.png)\n\n### 3. Browser window dimensions are all over the map\nThis chart shows bubbles which are bigger depending on how many different IPs\nreport the same browser window dimensions. Tragically it seems that there is no\nway to predict what aspect ratio a device using CryptPad is going to have.\n![Browser window dimensions](/images/Analytics-browserdimensions.png)\n\n### 4. Lots of pads are made and then abandoned\nThe first chart shows in blue the number of pads created each day and the number\nof pads which become \"abandoned\" (have not been touched in 2 weeks). This says\nthat perhaps pads are considered ephemeral and not to be used for the long term.\n![Created vs. abandoned pads](/images/Analytics-createdabandoned.png)\n\nHere we can see the evolution of pads which have been accessed within the last\nday the last week and the last month. There is slow but steady growth in the\npads active in the past month.\n![Number of active pads](/images/Analytics-activepads.png)\n\n### 5. People use CryptPad for a while, then leave\nWe measured 15,000 IP addresses which came to CryptPad just to look at one pad and\nthen left, but of the 13,000 who stayed longer than that we analyzed the time when\nthey first arrived and the time when they made their last visit. About 630 IP\naddressses have been continually using CryptPad for all 45 days.\n![Number of IPs continuing to access CryptPad](/images/Analytics-peopleleave.png)\nWe want to make CryptPad a useful tool for helping people get organized and make\ntheir projects succeed. So whenever people decide that CryptPad is not the right\nanswer for them, we care about what went wrong and how we can make it better.\n\n## How we analyze this data\n\nWe do all of our analysis ourselves, and we don't share any of this data with Google\nor other data companies. We're thankful to\n[Kibana/ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) and\n[LogStash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) for making it possible to do\nin depth analysis on our own computers without resorting to a cloud service.\n","source":"_posts/cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CryptPad Analytics & Privacy - What we can't know, what we must know, what we want to know\ndate: 2017-07-07 13:41:02\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - analytics\n  - data\n  - privacy\n---\n\nCryptPad is a Zero Knowledge cloud application, this means we have designed it such\nthat we do not have any access to the content which is hosted on our server.\nHowever, there are other things which we do collect and it is important that\nprivacy-minded users understand what we are collecting and why.

Since we don't know your username,\nto us you are identified by a public signing key, something like this:\n\n`YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A`\n\nWe know that `YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A` has 392 MB of data in\ntheir CryptDrive including a pad of some type which has the ID\n`fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390` and an uploaded which we know as\n`ff2fdf9bb99ecc89d29d780780de10efdac14ed15e93b235`. One of these pads that they\nhave is actually their drive itself, but we don't strictly know which one (again,\nwe can take guesses based on the size of the patches). You can find out what your\nsigning key is by looking at in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings).\n\nWe also know when each pad was last accessed so that we can know to delete pads\nwhich are not in anybody's CryptDrive and have not been opened in a long time.\n\n### Why we can't avoid collecting IP addresses\n\nBeing able to know how many *different* people are using CryptPad is very important\nto us. One rather rude person decided to try to crash our server by creating 647,533\npads. They didn't put much thought into their attack because what they were doing\nwas not actually creating pads, but it illustrates the problem that if we don't\nknow how many *different* people are using the server, we don't have any idea\nwhether we are popular or under attack. Worse, we don't know what features have\nwidespread support vs. which ones are only popular with a few prolific users.\n\nOne obvious thought is to simply run the IP addresses through a hash function the\nway we traditionally hash passwords. However this sadly cannot work because there\nare only 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses and constructing a\n[rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) to get back the\noriginal IP addresses would take only about 1 day of computer time. So in the end\nwe simply log the IP addresses and don't worry about it.\n\n### What a pad looks like to us\n\nA pad is stored as a file which represents a sequence of encrypted *patches*.\nThese patches change the content of the pad from nothing to whatever it becomes in\nthe end. A typical message looks something like this:\n```\n[0,\"69d46337f826c0ecd881be59c119a527\",\"MSG\",\"fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390\",\"51Q....\"]\n```\nIt starts with a zero and then your temporary random ID, then it contains the word\nMSG and the ID of the pad which it is sent to, this format is exactly the same as\nwhat is sent on the wire. Finally it contains the encrypted patch which tells us\nessentially nothing except it gives us a rough idea of just how big the change was.\n\nOccasionally the client will send a *checkpoint*, this is a special patch which\nremoves all of the content and then puts it all back again. To us, a checkpoint\nlooks the same as anything else, it is a big ball of encrypted data, except in this\ncase it is flagged as a checkpoint so the server knows it can send only part of\nthe history of the pad instead of all of it. However, they do give us a good idea\nof how big the pad actually is at that time.\n\n## What we collect because we want to know\n\nWhat we really want to understand is your *experience* with CryptPad and how we can\nmake that experience better. So therefore we collect quite a number of data-points\nabout where people click and what their browser supports. For example we collect\nthe dimensions of your browser. Not because we want to know who you are but because\nwe want to know that types of browsers we need to support.\n\n```\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:21:26:15 +0200]\n\"HEAD /common/feedback.html?DIMENSIONS:752x1440=1499369175085 HTTP/1.1\" 200 0\n\"https://cryptpad.fr/settings/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5)\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109 Safari/537.36\" \"-\"\n```\n\nYou can see an exhaustive list of things that we collect by checking out the\n[feedback functionality](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/search?p=2&q=Cryptpad.feedback&type=&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in the CryptPad source code but\nas of the time of this writing, we are collecting feedback about the following\nthings (usually we just collect the fact that an event occurred, not more).\n\n* Clicking \"upgrade account\"\n* Clicking \"support cryptpad\"\n* Presentation: clicking on \"print slides\"\n* Registering and logging in\n* Opening your recent pads as an anonymous user\n* Clicking any CKEditor button such as \"bold\" or \"italic\"\n* Displaying the drive as icons or as a list\n* Creating and using templates\n* Showing and hiding the userlist or CKEditor menu bar\n* Whether your browser is missing certain important features like\n[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy),\n[isArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray)\nor [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)\n* Which type of pad you are using\n* The dimensions of your browser window\n* When you have changed your display name\n* Whether you have migrated your CryptDrive from the legacy format\n\nIf you are worried about what we might do with this data, you can disable\nfeedback collection in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings/). But\nkeep in mind that if you disable it we cannot help but know, because your IP\naddress will be in the tiny minority of addresses which access the site but don't\nsend feedback messages.\n\n## What we can learn from the data\n\n\n### 1. People mostly use CryptPad to make a plain old pad\nBut the code/markdown pad and the CryptDrive are catching up.\n![Unique IPs per pad type](/images/Analytics-padtypes.png)\n\n### 2. Activity has been on a very slow rise but with a few spikes\nThis chart shows unique IPs per day hitting CryptPad. You can things are relatively\nflat over time except for a big day in June and then some increased activity in July\nafter the UI improvements were rolled out.\n![Unique IPs per day](/images/Analytics-uniques.png)\n\n### 3. Browser window dimensions are all over the map\nThis chart shows bubbles which are bigger depending on how many different IPs\nreport the same browser window dimensions. Tragically it seems that there is no\nway to predict what aspect ratio a device using CryptPad is going to have.\n![Browser window dimensions](/images/Analytics-browserdimensions.png)\n\n### 4. Lots of pads are made and then abandoned\nThe first chart shows in blue the number of pads created each day and the number\nof pads which become \"abandoned\" (have not been touched in 2 weeks). This says\nthat perhaps pads are considered ephemeral and not to be used for the long term.\n![Created vs. abandoned pads](/images/Analytics-createdabandoned.png)\n\nHere we can see the evolution of pads which have been accessed within the last\nday the last week and the last month. There is slow but steady growth in the\npads active in the past month.\n![Number of active pads](/images/Analytics-activepads.png)\n\n### 5. People use CryptPad for a while, then leave\nWe measured 15,000 IP addresses which came to CryptPad just to look at one pad and\nthen left, but of the 13,000 who stayed longer than that we analyzed the time when\nthey first arrived and the time when they made their last visit. About 630 IP\naddressses have been continually using CryptPad for all 45 days.\n![Number of IPs continuing to access CryptPad](/images/Analytics-peopleleave.png)\nWe want to make CryptPad a useful tool for helping people get organized and make\ntheir projects succeed. So whenever people decide that CryptPad is not the right\nanswer for them, we care about what went wrong and how we can make it better.\n\n## How we analyze this data\n\nWe do all of our analysis ourselves, and we don't share any of this data with Google\nor other data companies. We're thankful to\n[Kibana/ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) and\n[LogStash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) for making it possible to do\nin depth analysis on our own computers without resorting to a cloud service.\n","slug":"cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know","published":1,"updated":"2019-07-16T09:24:05.761Z","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","_id":"cktsjy9vb001ycya8ob3wlg3n","content":"<p>CryptPad is a Zero Knowledge cloud application, this means we have designed it such\nthat we do not have any access to the content which is hosted on our server.\nHowever, there are other things which we do collect and it is important that\nprivacy-minded users understand what we are collecting and why.

There are four\ntypes of information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What we can’t know: This is data that CryptPad app encrypts so we will never have\naccess to it</li>\n<li>What we must see but don’t collect: This is information which we don’t bother\nto store but because of how the technology works, we necessarily have access to it.</li>\n<li>What we must know: This is metadata which we cannot help but see because of the\nway the technology works</li>\n<li>What we want to know: This is information which we really want to know in order\nto make CryptPad better every day</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to know everything about <em>people</em>, we want to know how <em>people</em> use CryptPad,\nwhy <em>people</em> use CryptPad and how we can make their experience easier. However, we\ndon’t want to know anything at all about <em>you</em>.</p>\n<p>This poses a challenge because we want to collect as much aggregate information as we\ncan in order to make a great web service, but we don’t want to collect data that can\nbe <em>linked</em> in order to tell a story about you.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we-can’t-know\"><a href=\"#What-we-can’t-know\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we can’t know\"></a>What we can’t know</h2><p>There are a few things which the Zero Knowledge design of CryptPad does not allow\nus to know at all. These include (obviously) your password and the content of your\npads, but less obviously, the titles of your pads, the names of the contributors and\nyour username (you can even have the same username as someone else on the system, we\nwon’t know).

Since we don’t know your username,\nto us you are identified by a public signing key, something like this:</p>\n<p><code>YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A</code></p>\n<p>We know that <code>YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A</code> has 392 MB of data in\ntheir CryptDrive including a pad of some type which has the ID\n<code>fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390</code> and an uploaded which we know as\n<code>ff2fdf9bb99ecc89d29d780780de10efdac14ed15e93b235</code>. One of these pads that they\nhave is actually their drive itself, but we don’t strictly know which one (again,\nwe can take guesses based on the size of the patches). You can find out what your\nsigning key is by looking at in your <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/settings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">settings page</a>.</p>\n<p>We also know when each pad was last accessed so that we can know to delete pads\nwhich are not in anybody’s CryptDrive and have not been opened in a long time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Why-we-can’t-avoid-collecting-IP-addresses\"><a href=\"#Why-we-can’t-avoid-collecting-IP-addresses\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Why we can’t avoid collecting IP addresses\"></a>Why we can’t avoid collecting IP addresses</h3><p>Being able to know how many <em>different</em> people are using CryptPad is very important\nto us. One rather rude person decided to try to crash our server by creating 647,533\npads. They didn’t put much thought into their attack because what they were doing\nwas not actually creating pads, but it illustrates the problem that if we don’t\nknow how many <em>different</em> people are using the server, we don’t have any idea\nwhether we are popular or under attack. Worse, we don’t know what features have\nwidespread support vs. which ones are only popular with a few prolific users.</p>\n<p>One obvious thought is to simply run the IP addresses through a hash function the\nway we traditionally hash passwords. However this sadly cannot work because there\nare only 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses and constructing a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rainbow table</a> to get back the\noriginal IP addresses would take only about 1 day of computer time. So in the end\nwe simply log the IP addresses and don’t worry about it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"What-a-pad-looks-like-to-us\"><a href=\"#What-a-pad-looks-like-to-us\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What a pad looks like to us\"></a>What a pad looks like to us</h3><p>A pad is stored as a file which represents a sequence of encrypted <em>patches</em>.\nThese patches change the content of the pad from nothing to whatever it becomes in\nthe end. A typical message looks something like this:\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">[0,&quot;69d46337f826c0ecd881be59c119a527&quot;,&quot;MSG&quot;,&quot;fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390&quot;,&quot;51Q....&quot;]</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>It starts with a zero and then your temporary random ID, then it contains the word\nMSG and the ID of the pad which it is sent to, this format is exactly the same as\nwhat is sent on the wire. Finally it contains the encrypted patch which tells us\nessentially nothing except it gives us a rough idea of just how big the change was.</p>\n<p>Occasionally the client will send a <em>checkpoint</em>, this is a special patch which\nremoves all of the content and then puts it all back again. To us, a checkpoint\nlooks the same as anything else, it is a big ball of encrypted data, except in this\ncase it is flagged as a checkpoint so the server knows it can send only part of\nthe history of the pad instead of all of it. However, they do give us a good idea\nof how big the pad actually is at that time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we-collect-because-we-want-to-know\"><a href=\"#What-we-collect-because-we-want-to-know\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we collect because we want to know\"></a>What we collect because we want to know</h2><p>What we really want to understand is your <em>experience</em> with CryptPad and how we can\nmake that experience better. So therefore we collect quite a number of data-points\nabout where people click and what their browser supports. For example we collect\nthe dimensions of your browser.

[4.6](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.6.0) was a stability update addressing many minor issues while the team prepared for [4.7](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.7.0) and a major new feature: the new *Forms* application.\n\n## Say hello to Forms!\n\n![Preview of the new Form application](/images/form-preview.png)  \n\nThe *Poll* application in CryptPad was aimed at choosing a meeting date between a group of people. However it had some major shortcomings including \"all or nothing\" edit rights where participants could modify other people's answers. Part of our [Dialogue](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/) project proposal was to address these issues in a complete re-write of the application. Another aspect of the project aims to provide a new application for online surveys beyond simple polls.   \n\nThe new *Form* application is an answer to both of these proposals. Polls are now one of 8 question types that can be added to an online form. Earlier in the project we [spun out the reminders API element of forms into a full blown calendar app](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/04/26/status-april-2021/). With *Forms* we are merging a variety of use cases into one application. As we have [indicated](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad/106419898274848746) polls created with the old application remain available, but the creation of new ones is discouraged and all our future development efforts will be directed at *Forms*.  \n\nWe released the first Beta version of forms with CryptPad [4.7.0](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/4.7.0) (on June 16th). There are many things we still want to improve, including:   \n\n- Export of responses (e.g. to .CSV)  \n- Better visualization of responses (e.g. with simple bar charts)  \n- \"Required\" questions that would print an error if left empty  \n- Notifications for form authors (e.g. when someone has responded)  \n- A default \"poll\" template to make it easy to replicate the behaviour of the deprecated *Poll* app  \n\nWe are gathering feedback on these and anything else that might be improved, using the *Form* app itself for a feedback survey that is open until **July 12th**. Please [let us know of any comments on the application](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/gYs4QS7DetInCXy0z2CQoUW6CwN6kaR2utGsftDzp58/) and what you would like to see improved, especially if you use online forms regularly. We really appreciate the time of nearly 100 people who have already sent in their comments. These will inform our work as we improve *Forms* this summer.  \n\nDetails on how to use the *Form* application are available in the [CryptPad User Guide](https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/user_guide/apps/form.html).  \n\n\n## A call to instance administrators\n\nThis month we sent out our first—and last—mass email to CryptPad instance administrators. This was a strange feeling for a team that spends most of its time working on ways to **not** know anything about its users. However we felt that version 4.7.0 was a good time to remind all admins to upgrade to latest version, and to ask for their consent for future communications as this is now managed directly from the admin panel.  \n\nFirst of all, how did we have their email? The configuration for a new instance includes providing an email contact for the administrator, and this is sent to the development team in the daily \"ping\" that lets us know how many declared CryptPad instances are active. This is all detailed in the configuration file that admins read when setting up their instance.  \n\nIn both releases this month we have made improvements to the administration panel of CryptPad instances. More settings, such as the setup for the Support ticket mailbox, are now available from the panel rather than buried in configuration files. This also includes new settings for administrators to manage how they communicate (or not) with the development team.   \n\nThe \"mass email\" was to encourage all administrators to upgrade to the latest 4.7.0 version in order to 1) benefit from all of the new features and security improvements made to CryptPad in the last few months (or years depending on the version they were on) and 2) manage further communication with the development team going forward. These communications will include security notifications and other things such as inclusion in a directory of open instances that we are working on setting up.   \n\n---  \n\nThere is one last bit of news to wrap up: CryptPad is now included in [Catalogue GouvTech, a software directory curated by the French state](https://catalogue.numerique.gouv.fr/solutions/cryptpad)  \n\nThe next month will be spent improving *Forms* and starting work on our [INTEROFFICE project](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/04/26/status-april-2021/) for [DAPSI](https://dapsi.ngi.eu), working towards improved import/export and document conversions from within CryptPad.  \n\n","source":"_posts/status-june-2021.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"June 2021 status: Forms and a call to instance administrators\"\ndate: 2021-06-28 11:24:33\nauthor: David Benqué\ntags:\n  - status update\n  - administration\n  - forms\n---\n\nThis month we released two versions of CryptPad.

Both improved CryptPad's stability and performance: \n\n- Version 4.2 saw Offline mode extended to Teams, shared folders within teams, and files. [Summary on Mastodon](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad/105825790198276067)\n- Version 4.3 focused on improving \"intensive\" use cases, defined as 1200+ concurrent viewers on the same document, or 10+ editors all writing at once. [Summary on Mastodon](https://social.weho.st/@cryptpad/105950727247053276)\n\nIn this status we'll focus on long requested updates to Spreadsheets and on other activities of note for the month. \n\n\n## Spreadsheet updates\n\nWe made a couple of important updates to the Spreadsheets application this month. First we enabled OnlyOffice's *Strict* collaboration mode, in addition to the *Fast* mode that was already integrated. In Fast mode, which remains the default, new edits are synchronized automatically between users as they are made. In Strict mode, users \"lock\" cells as they edit them and they have to manually save their changes in order for them to be sent to other users. The benefit of Strict mode is that it allows users to **Undo** their unsaved changes. The lack of undo in sheets has been a recurring point in user feedback. This goes some way towards addressing these requests, at least within the constraints of OnlyOffice collaboration. There are more details on how to switch between modes in our [Spreadsheet documentation](https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/user_guide/apps/sheets.html#undo-and-collaboration-modes).\n\nThe other notable change is the update to OnlyOffice 6.2 in our 4.3 release.

The first major step in this direction is the introduction of our [Public Roadmap Kanban](https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/) where we detail all of the research projects we are currently working on. We summarise each project, funding amount, and associated features. Using the tags feature to filter one project gives an overview of its completion status. We find this very useful and hope you will find it informative. \n\n[![The Public Roadmap Kanban](/images/roadmap-kanban.png)](https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/)\n\nThe next steps planned in this direction include a review of the onboarding document (the first document that is placed in new user's CryptDrives), as well as a rewrite of the Privacy Policy for cryptpad.fr. This last one is nearly complete and will be published as a rich text document. \n\n\n## Cleaned up translations\n\nWe have started an effort to reduce the amount of work needed to translate CryptPad. As the development team we maintain English and French, and an active German speaking community maintains the German translation in near real-time for which we are very grateful. We want to encourage people to translate CryptPad in other languages, and to complete the many languages where the translation has been started but not completed. \n\nPast efforts towards this have included moving the Frequently Asked Questions out of the platform to [a dedicated page in the documentation](https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/FAQ.html). This month we have taken further steps with automated scripts to detect un-used translations. These were left over from previous versions of CryptPad and were sometimes hard to detect in the code. There is now less work for translators, and better assurance that no time will be wasted translating text that isn't actually used in the product. \n\nWe are keeping this in mind for future versions and will do our best to facilitate the work of community translators as much as we can. If you are interested in translating CryptPad, please head over to our [Weblate instance](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/cryptpad/app/). \n\nThis wraps up our monthly status update. There is more to look forward to in April as we move to complete our *Communities* project, and exciting things on the horizon for CryptPad's interoperability with office formats.\n","source":"_posts/status-march-2021.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"March 2021 status: Public roadmap and Spreadsheet updates\"\ndate: 2021-03-29 11:58:46\nauthor: David Benqué\ntags:\n  - status update\n  - talk\n  - spreadsheet\n  - roadmap\n---\n\nThis month we released two versions of CryptPad, 4.2 and 4.3.

Additionally, admins can now check that their installation is complete and well configured with an improved `/checkup/` page.   \n\nThe [documentation GitHub repo](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad-documentation) remains open for feedback and/or contributions, and please see [Weblate](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/user-guide/) for translations of the User Guide (note that the developer and admin guides are in English only to keep translation of the user guide manageable).  \n\nRestricted registrations and the admin guide were the remaining two deliverables for the [Communities project](https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad-Communities/). For a summary of all features implemented for this project over the last few months, visit our [public roadmap](https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/) and filter with the \"communities\" tag.   \n\nWhile we are on the topic of wrapping up projects, Aaron took part in the [6th NGI TRUST Results Webinar](https://www.ngi.eu/event/ngi_trust-webinar-results-6/?instance_id=519) and summarised our work for that project which [we completed last February](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/02/24/status-feb-2021/)  \n\n\n## Preparations for Forms\n\nWith some projects completed we can now turn another major milestone ahead: the [Dialogue project](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/) and a new app: Forms. This will allow for the creation of surveys and questionnaires with use-cases ranging from finding a meeting date to conducting research in a secure and private manner. We are only in the initial stages of development but once completed the Forms app will gradually replace our current Polls and their many shortcomings (such as anyone being able to modify anyone else's answers). If you use Polls currently, rest assured that the new app will provide the same functionality and more. The migration strategy remains to be finalised but existing Polls will remain available through the transition.   \n\n\n## Coverage\n\nFinally, the team took part in a couple of events this month.

We presented the poster below in the exhibition space.

Additionally, admins can now check that their installation is complete and well configured with an improved `/checkup/` page.   \n\nThe [documentation GitHub repo](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad-documentation) remains open for feedback and/or contributions, and please see [Weblate](https://weblate.cryptpad.fr/projects/user-guide/) for translations of the User Guide (note that the developer and admin guides are in English only to keep translation of the user guide manageable).  \n\nRestricted registrations and the admin guide were the remaining two deliverables for the [Communities project](https://nlnet.nl/project/Cryptpad-Communities/). For a summary of all features implemented for this project over the last few months, visit our [public roadmap](https://cryptpad.fr/kanban/#/2/kanban/view/PLM0C3tFWvYhd+EPzXrbT+NxB76Z5DtZhAA5W5hG9wo/) and filter with the \"communities\" tag.   \n\nWhile we are on the topic of wrapping up projects, Aaron took part in the [6th NGI TRUST Results Webinar](https://www.ngi.eu/event/ngi_trust-webinar-results-6/?instance_id=519) and summarised our work for that project which [we completed last February](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2021/02/24/status-feb-2021/)  \n\n\n## Preparations for Forms\n\nWith some projects completed we can now turn another major milestone ahead: the [Dialogue project](https://nlnet.nl/project/CryptPadForms/) and a new app: Forms. This will allow for the creation of surveys and questionnaires with use-cases ranging from finding a meeting date to conducting research in a secure and private manner. We are only in the initial stages of development but once completed the Forms app will gradually replace our current Polls and their many shortcomings (such as anyone being able to modify anyone else's answers). If you use Polls currently, rest assured that the new app will provide the same functionality and more. The migration strategy remains to be finalised but existing Polls will remain available through the transition.   \n\n\n## Coverage\n\nFinally, the team took part in a couple of events this month.

We have integrated the two remaining [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/) editors for text documents and presentations into CryptPad's real-time encrypted collaboration engine. This completes the OnlyOffice suite, as spreadsheets have been available for some time. Like our spreadsheet editor, these two new applications [only rely on OnlyOffice's client-side components, not its server](https://docs.cryptpad.fr/en/FAQ.html#what-is-the-relationship-between-cryptpad-and-onlyoffice).\n\nThis work is combined with our ongoing efforts to improve import and export of documents funded by [NGI DAPSI](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/). As a result CryptPad will be much more inter-operable with existing office suites and their file formats, for example with the ability to import and export _docx_, _pptx_, and _xslx_ files, as well as the open document formats _odt_, _odp_, and _ods_. Additionally, documents in these formats that are uploaded to CryptPad will no longer be treated only as static files.

All of the funded projects gave updates on their progress. We were in very good company alongside [Delta Chat](https://delta.chat), [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/), and [many more](https://dapsi.ngi.eu/meet-the-round-2-innovators-moving-to-phase-2/). All projects were succesful in moving to phase 2.\n\n[![Tweet from NGI DAPSI about the pitch day](/images/DAPSI_pitch_tweet.png)](https://twitter.com/cryptpad/status/1443875782376542231)\n\nWe were happy to present the progress on INTEROFFICE, our project to improve the import/export of popular office formats to/from CryptPad. Most of the technical work on Web Assembly converters is done. This means all conversions happen in the browser (rather that on the server like in most other tools) and we can do this without seeing any of the content that is being converted.\n\nPart of the project is to release this work as open-source packages so other projects can benefit from this work. We are planning to do this in December once the libraries have been thoroughly tested on CryptPad.\n\n![Preview of the new \"Open in...\" feature. Right clicking a compatible file in the drive shows this menu](/images/open-in_preview.png)\n\nCryptPad users will benefit too, with new functionality becoming available on the platform. Files in popular formats such as .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .odt, .ods, and .odp are no longer being treated only as static files once they are uploaded to CryptPad. A new menu item called \"Open in ...\" makes them editable in the corresponding application. Which brings us to: \n\n## Two new app releases\n\nWe have long been planning to add OnlyOffice's Document and Presentation applications to CryptPad, completing the suite that  started with Spreadsheet in 2019. The improved inter-operability we built with INTEROFFICE makes this a good time to finally release these applications, to make the most our of the new imports and exports. As part of the [4.12 release](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/4.12.0) we launched these new apps as \"early access\", which means only subscribers on cryptpad.fr can create new documents and they are available on other instances if administrators opt-in. We [wrote about this in more detail in our last post](https://blog.cryptpad.org/2021/10/21/Announcing-new-apps/).\n\n![Preview of the new Document application.](/images/OO-doc-preview.png)\n\n![Preview of the new Presentation application.](/images/OO-slide-preview.png)\n\nThis launch made us reconsider our current release schedule. We may revisit this in the near future and move towards a slower pace where each release would have bigger changes. This would potentially come with a more readable naming scheme as well, perhaps taking a leaf out of Canonical's playbook where Ubuntu releases are time-stamped rather than numbered. We will come back to this, likely in the new year, and write about any changes here.\n\n## NGI0 PET coming to an end\n\nThis month marks the end of the [NGI0 _Privacy Enhancing Technologies_](https://nlnet.nl/PET) program (previously known as NLnet PET), that will wrap up on October 31st. CryptPad has benefited a lot from this funding, with 3 projects over 3 years. To name but a few, these are some of the major features that were made possible through this support: \n\n- Teams (incl. team drive, roles, etc)\n- Full documentation for users, administrators, and developers\n- Calendars\n- The Form application\n\nWe are very thankful for this ongoing support. NGI0 created an approachable way for development teams like ours to access funds from the European Commission, creating real impact with minimal red tape. The fund was established by NLnet with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu) programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology under [grant agreement No 825310](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/825310).\n\nThis concludes this month's updates. Next up for the team is some thorough testing of the new applications and fixing any issues that get reported by early-access testers. Besides this we will be continuing with work on INTEROFFICE towards the project conclusion in January 2022.\n\n\n","source":"_posts/status-2021-10.md","raw":"---\ntitle: \"October 2021 status: A pitch and a farewell \"\ndate: 2021-10-27 10:57:29\nauthor: David Benqué\ntags:\n  - status update\n  - interoperability\n  - ngi \n  - research\n---\n\nThis month we released CryptPad [4.12](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/4.12.0) with some much anticipated new applications.\n\n\n## NGI DAPSI Pitch Day \n\nOn the first day of the month we took part in the DAPSI Pitch Day.

All of the funded projects gave updates on their progress. We were in very good company alongside <a href=\"https://delta.chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta Chat</a>, <a href=\"https://postmarketos.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">postmarketOS</a>, and <a href=\"https://dapsi.ngi.eu/meet-the-round-2-innovators-moving-to-phase-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">many more</a>. All projects were succesful in moving to phase 2.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cryptpad/status/1443875782376542231\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img src=\"/images/DAPSI_pitch_tweet.png\" alt=\"Tweet from NGI DAPSI about the pitch day\"></a></p>\n<p>We were happy to present the progress on INTEROFFICE, our project to improve the import/export of popular office formats to/from CryptPad. Most of the technical work on Web Assembly converters is done. This means all conversions happen in the browser (rather that on the server like in most other tools) and we can do this without seeing any of the content that is being converted.</p>\n<p>Part of the project is to release this work as open-source packages so other projects can benefit from this work. We are planning to do this in December once the libraries have been thoroughly tested on CryptPad.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/open-in_preview.png\" alt=\"Preview of the new &quot;Open in...&quot; feature. Right clicking a compatible file in the drive shows this menu\"></p>\n<p>CryptPad users will benefit too, with new functionality becoming available on the platform. Files in popular formats such as .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .odt, .ods, and .odp are no longer being treated only as static files once they are uploaded to CryptPad. A new menu item called “Open in …” makes them editable in the corresponding application. Which brings us to: </p>\n<h2 id=\"Two-new-app-releases\"><a href=\"#Two-new-app-releases\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Two new app releases\"></a>Two new app releases</h2><p>We have long been planning to add OnlyOffice’s Document and Presentation applications to CryptPad, completing the suite that  started with Spreadsheet in 2019. The improved inter-operability we built with INTEROFFICE makes this a good time to finally release these applications, to make the most our of the new imports and exports. As part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/4.12.0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">4.12 release</a> we launched these new apps as “early access”, which means only subscribers on cryptpad.fr can create new documents and they are available on other instances if administrators opt-in. We <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.org/2021/10/21/Announcing-new-apps/\">wrote about this in more detail in our last post</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/OO-doc-preview.png\" alt=\"Preview of the new Document application.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/OO-slide-preview.png\" alt=\"Preview of the new Presentation application.\"></p>\n<p>This launch made us reconsider our current release schedule. We may revisit this in the near future and move towards a slower pace where each release would have bigger changes. This would potentially come with a more readable naming scheme as well, perhaps taking a leaf out of Canonical’s playbook where Ubuntu releases are time-stamped rather than numbered. We will come back to this, likely in the new year, and write about any changes here.</p>\n<h2 id=\"NGI0-PET-coming-to-an-end\"><a href=\"#NGI0-PET-coming-to-an-end\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"NGI0 PET coming to an end\"></a>NGI0 PET coming to an end</h2><p>This month marks the end of the <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/PET\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NGI0 <em>Privacy Enhancing Technologies</em></a> program (previously known as NLnet PET), that will wrap up on October 31st.

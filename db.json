biweekly releases","date":"2017-02-24T15:26:03.000Z","author":"Aaron MacSween","_content":"\nWhen I joined the research team at [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.com/en/team/) a little over a year ago, CryptPad was very much an experiment.\nWe had ideas of what we wanted to accomplish, but we didn't know whether it would work at all, let alone how we were going to get there.\n\nWe've come a long way since then.\nHaving proven that _zero knowledge, real time collaborative editing_ in the browser was possible, we've been thinking about an even more difficult task:\n\n> How do we make this something that _anybody_ can use?\n\n## How we've gotten here\n\nWe've built CryptPad from a number of small pieces.\nIn some cases, we were lucky enough to find existing software libraries which solved our problems.\nWe love when this happens because it keeps us from having to reinvent the wheel, leaving more time for unsolved problems.\n\nWhen you try to build something that nobody has built before, however, you run into problems that nobody else cares about.\nWe've had to build a lot of our own components, and some of them have been incredibly complicated.\n\nSome bugs only become obvious under very odd circumstances, when users with different browsers do very specific sequences or combinations of actions.\nOur growing userbase has been critical in helping us to identify these kinds of issues, and things have been improving steadily.\n\n## What we've learned\n\nOur longest delays have come from working on tough problems that managed to get tangled up with smaller bug fixes, which kept them from reaching our users.\nAt the end of 2016, however, most of these big, complicated issues were coming to a close.\nOur team took some much-needed vacation time, and upon returning we started working to release and deploy a tagged version of our codebase.\n\nOur newest features went live to [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) on Tuesday, the 14th of February.\nSome of them are big enough that we'll probably dedicate entire blog posts to them, but the release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/1.0.0).\n\n## Our new release policy\n\nIn the interest of getting feedback from our users more quickly, we've decided to adopt a two week release cycle.\nWe're going to focus on delivering features that directly improve your experience.\n\nThe live site will run code from our latest _master_ branch, while the upcoming release will be on the [staging](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/staging) branch.\n\nEach release will come with a set of notes detailing what we did, and known issues that didn't quite make it into that version.\nWe'll work on getting those issues fixed in the following cycle.\n\nWhenever we deploy these big updates, we'll announce when we expect the next one to arrive.\nSince we started on a Tuesday, we expect to deploy again on Tuesday, February the 28th, 2017.\n\n## Codenamed releases\n\nSince it's difficult to

- Release\n---\n\nWhen I joined the research team at [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.com/en/team/) a little over a year ago, CryptPad was very much an experiment.\nWe had ideas of what we wanted to accomplish, but we didn't know whether it would work at all, let alone how we were going to get there.\n\nWe've come a long way since then.\nHaving proven that _zero knowledge, real time collaborative editing_ in the browser was possible, we've been thinking about an even more difficult task:\n\n> How do we make this something that _anybody_ can use?\n\n## How we've gotten here\n\nWe've built CryptPad from a number of small pieces.\nIn some cases, we were lucky enough to find existing software libraries which solved our problems.\nWe love when this happens because it keeps us from having to reinvent the wheel, leaving more time for unsolved problems.\n\nWhen you try to build something that nobody has built before, however, you run into problems that nobody else cares about.\nWe've had to build a lot of our own components, and some of them have been incredibly complicated.\n\nSome bugs only become obvious under very odd circumstances, when users with different browsers do very specific sequences or combinations of actions.\nOur growing userbase has been critical in helping us to identify these kinds of issues, and things have been improving steadily.\n\n## What we've learned\n\nOur longest delays have come from working on tough problems that managed to get tangled up with smaller bug fixes, which kept them from reaching our users.\nAt the end of 2016, however, most of these big, complicated issues were coming to a close.\nOur team took some much-needed vacation time, and upon returning we started working to release and deploy a tagged version of our codebase.\n\nOur newest features went live to [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) on Tuesday, the 14th of February.\nSome of them are big enough that we'll probably dedicate entire blog posts to them, but the release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/1.0.0).\n\n## Our new release policy\n\nIn the interest of getting feedback from our users more quickly, we've decided to adopt a two week release cycle.\nWe're going to focus on delivering features that directly improve your experience.\n\nThe live site will run code from our latest _master_ branch, while the upcoming release will be on the [staging](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/staging) branch.\n\nEach release will come with a set of notes detailing what we did, and known issues that didn't quite make it into that version.\nWe'll work on getting those issues fixed in the following cycle.\n\nWhenever we deploy these big updates, we'll announce when we expect the next one to arrive.\nSince we started on a Tuesday, we expect to deploy again on Tuesday, February the 28th, 2017.\n\n## Codenamed releases\n\nSince it's difficult to remember versions of the software if they have names like `1.0.0`, we've decided to give each one a more memorable codename.\nWith there being 26 letters in the Latin alphabet, and 26 two week releases in the year, we started looking for alphabetical lists

\n*People hosting instances of CryptPad should read at least the\n[Changes in CryptPad](/2017/06/02/Building-mutually-beneficial-relationships/#Changes-in-CryptPad)\nsection*\n \n*Thanks to Scott Alexander for some of the\n[ethical foundations](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)\nof this post.*\n \n---\n \nYou ever wonder why Open Source software always seems to be slightly harder\nto use and slightly buggier and slightly less *polished* than proprietary\ncompetitors?\n \nHow about this: Why is it that good people who want to make good things somehow\nend up making evil things for evil corporations which sell them to other good\npeople who would (presumably) rather buy good things.\n\n\n## It's all about incentives\n \nIt's hard to talk about incentives without sounding like a miserly tool, but if\nwe're going to hack ourselves out of a situation that nobody really wants to be in,\nwe're going to need to understand them pretty well.\n \n* Why is Open Source habitually *90% of the way there* ?\n* Why is Facebook more addictive than it is useful ?\n* Why is it that when you get something for free, even from a well funded\ngovernment program, it's reliably worse than something you buy?\n \nIt's all about incentives.\n \n### In a restaurant, you're the customer\n \nI love going to restaurants. I have no car and few possessions so restaurants are\nthe way I spend my income. Not only do I love food but I love the relationship\nwhich I have with restaurateurs. When I walk into a restaurant, I want to be fed\ndelicious food and they want to be paid, not only that, they want me to be happy\nso I will return many times and bring my friends. I want them to be happy so they\nwill give me bigger portions and maybe a little dessert on the house. Our\nincentives are aligned perfectly. We are practically a team.\n\n### In a soup kitchen, you're just a user\n\nIt is hard to deny the importance of soup kitchens to the fabric of society.\nPart of what makes us able to claim to be civilized is the fact that we don't let\npeople simply die if they're down on their luck. Soup kitchens, however, are not\nrestaurants. When you walk into a soup kitchen, you are generally greeted kindly\nbut there is a subtle distinction from a restaurant, at a restaurant you're the\ncustomer and at a soup kitchen you're just a *user*. Many soup kitchens are\norganized around religious groups and  evangelizing their belief is a significant\npart of their motivation, but even secular organizations are motivated by some\nsort of a higher calling.\n\n### Open Source is a soup kitchen\n\nI've been developing Open Source both professionally and personally for 7 years\nand I'm going to tell you something that many Open Source developers won't admit.\nOpen Source software is not made for you. Sometimes Open Source developers are\nmotivated by the Free Software ideology and they imagine their code as\ntransforming the world, sometimes they just want to solve some problem for\nthemselves and they give away the resulting code. Open Source software is almost\nnever developed for the simple purpose of making another person's life a little\neasier.\n \n## If you aren't the customer you're the product\n \nThis aphorism has become popular with the rise of ad-tech and social network\nwebsites. The phrase invokes an image of free services coming like free grain\nbecause you are, in fact, the pig on his way to slaughter. In some way this is\ntrue, Silicon Valley business models are becoming disturbingly like human\nfarming.\n\nHowever, the phrase also invokes an image of an evil entrepreneur plotting to\nenslave humanity by creating a slick social network. If 1 in 1000 companies is\nsuccessful then logic implies there must be thousands of evil entrepreneurs\nrunning around everywhere. If this is true then where are all of the failed\nevil plotters? I've never met an entrepreneur who was anything less than an\naspiring saint.\n \nI think the real reason why social networks become human farms is because people\ndon't want to pay for development of web services and stuck between a successful\nhuman farm and a failing soup kitchen, entrepreneurs begrudgingly choose to farm.\n \n## Breaking out\n \nIf we're ever going to stop living in a world of farms and soup kitchens, we're\ngoing to need to get serious about incentives. Part of my intention in starting\nthe CryptPad project is to build something that is not a farm nor a soup kitchen.\nI want to have a mutually beneficial relationship with every one of CryptPad's\nusers, including you. I don't want to be a charity worker beholden to an NGO or\na post office clerk drawing a paycheck from the state. I want you to be my boss,\nI want to obsess about making your life better, I want fair exchange of value\nand aligned incentives.\n \n## Changes in CryptPad\n \n[As you may already know](/2017/05/23/CryptPad-use-it-love-it-support-it/),\ncryptpad.fr now limits your data storage and allows you to buy an account which\nwill raise that limit. The code for limits and accounts is also in the CryptPad\ncodebase and turned on by default. If you are installing CryptPad, you have\nthree choices.\n\n1. Leave it exactly as it is: People will be limited to 50MB of storage and they\nwill see a *Support CryptPad* button. In the development time this donated money\nbuys, we will pay special consideration to the needs of CryptPad admins like you.\n2. Share the revenue: If you specify some configuration parameters and send us\nan [email](mailto:sales@cryptpad.fr), the donation button will become an\n*Upgrade Account* button, allowing them to take a plan with additional storage\nquota. When people upgrade their account on your server, we will credit you 50%\nof the revenue earned. This helps us pay the cost of development and helps you\npay the cost of hosting.\n3. Disable the donate button: If you do this, we hope you will help CryptPad in\nsome other way such as by taking an on-premises support contract.\n\nIf you run a public CryptPad instance, please don't increase the 50MB per user\nstorage limit. This limit is what makes people subscribe and what pays for\nCryptPad development. Running a CryptPad instance which offers a \"better deal\"\nis effectively using the project against itself.\n\nFinally, new versions of CryptPad always check for new or expired accounts from\nour account server. We have added a parameter called *adminEmail* which will be\nsent along with the domain and version of CryptPad you're running. This way we\ncan notify you if we're aware of any a serious problems with your CryptPad\ninstance. We take your privacy seriously and will never sell your email or send\nyou marketing spam. If, however, you want to keep your CryptPad instance\ncompletely  hidden from us, you can set this parameter to **false** and it will\nnever query the account server.\n \n## Coming next\n \nOur objective is to help you collaborate, stay organized and get things done\nfaster and easier. We want to provide maximum value to you and we want you to\nprovide value to us so that we can continue doing it. As was said in the\nprevious post, the big issues which we are planning to tackle soon are:\n \n* File upload for PDF and image embedding\n* Text coloring based on the authors of the document\n* Workgroups for team collaboration\n* Zero Knowledge spreadsheets\n \nAs always, we will be continuing to put great effort into understanding your\nproblems, how you go about solving them, and how we can make little changes to\nmake CryptPad fit your needs better.\n \nCaleb\n \n","source":"_posts/Building-mutually-beneficial-relationships.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Building mutually beneficial relationships\ndate: 2017-06-02 13:52:47\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - Open Source\n  - Cloud\n  - Ethics\n---\n \n*People hosting instances of CryptPad should read at least the\n[Changes in CryptPad](/2017/06/02/Building-mutually-beneficial-relationships/#Changes-in-CryptPad)\nsection*\n \n*Thanks to Scott Alexander for some of the\n[ethical foundations](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)\nof this post.*\n \n---\n \nYou ever wonder why Open Source software always seems to be slightly harder\nto use and slightly buggier and slightly less *polished* than proprietary\ncompetitors?\n \nHow about this: Why is it that good people who want to make good things somehow\nend up making evil things for evil corporations which sell them to other good\npeople who would (presumably) rather buy good things.\n\n\n## It's all about incentives\n \nIt's hard to talk about incentives without sounding like a miserly tool, but if\nwe're going to hack ourselves out of a situation that nobody really wants to be in,\nwe're going to need to understand them pretty well.\n \n* Why is Open Source habitually *90% of the way there* ?\n* Why is Facebook more addictive than it is useful ?\n* Why is it that when you get something for free, even from a well funded\ngovernment program, it's reliably worse than something you buy?\n \nIt's all about incentives.\n \n### In a restaurant, you're the customer\n \nI love going to restaurants.

MacSween","_content":"\nCryptPad started as a novel idea:\n\n> provide a means for people to collaborate on the web, without their data being exposed to the server that connects them\n\nSince its conception as one developer's hobby project, this idea has grown organically into a team of core developers, a community of contributors, and a growing number of people who collaborate with CryptPad every day.\n\n## How we're able to do this work\n\nCryptPad is a part of the OpenPaaS-NG project, which is funded by [BPIFrance](http://www.bpifrance.fr/).\nAs mentioned in [our April 1st post](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/04/01/Exciting-news/), this funding only applies to 50% of our expenses.\nI joked that the other 50% was being covered by our new partners (the _**NSA**_), but in fact, the remainder is still covered entirely by [XWiki SAS](http://xwiki.com).\n\nWe have a fair amount of autonomy when it comes to deciding what features we will develop.\nWith that in mind, however, there are some long term goals that come as a part of OpenPaaS, some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.\n\nWe recognize that however people's goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.\n\nBy operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we're able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.\nOur ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.\n\nSince the [OpenPaaS-NG project](https://open-paas.org/) is only funded until 2019, we've been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.\n\n## Our new funding strategies\n\nMany of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.\n\nWe've chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we're doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe're willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are _willing to pay not to be a product themselves_.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.\n\n### Paid hosting\n\n[CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.\nSo far, this hasn't been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won't be something that we can sustain.\n\nIn many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.\nIn other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.\n\nTo address this problem, we've implemented **pinning**, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, _those which aren't pinned by a registered user_, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.\nWe believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.\n\n* Pinning will only be available to registered users.\n* Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017\n* Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.\n  * new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive\n  * removing a file from your drive's trash will unpin it\n* Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed\n  * effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)\n* Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.\n* For additional storage, you'll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.\n* We'll have more information about pricing soon.\n\n### Support contracts for private installations\n\nIf you've decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.\nLike you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.\n\nIf you're using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.\nWe're still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki's many customers in the past.\nYou can see an example of XWiki's pricing [here](http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise).\n\nIf you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.\nOtherwise, if you find that you're comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you'd like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we'll be there to help.\n\n### Sponsored development of open source features\n\nIf there's a particular feature you'd like to see implemented within CryptPad, we're able to dedicate development time to build it into the software in the best way possible.\n\nSponsored development allows us to build features to suit particular users' needs.\nBy integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.\nThis helps us refine those features to be even more useful for you, and ensures that they will continue to be supported well into the future.\n\n## What's next\n\nSince we announced our [bi-weekly release schedule](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/), we've tried to make sure that each release contains an exciting feature.\nThis time around, we've had to set some time aside to implement pinning, as well as code for reporting the size used by any one user's drive.\nWe realize this isn't especially interesting for most of you, but it will be necessary for some more advanced features which we hope to share with you soon.\n\nBy providing a quota system for our registered users, we will be able to offer encrypted file upload capabilities.\nYou'll be able to upload images, and embed them in presentations and pads, a process which has been somewhat difficult so far.\nOur decision to limit users' upload capacity is intended less to make a profit, and more to limit abuse.\n\nWe recognize that disk space is getting cheaper all the time, and that cloud hosting services will be able to offer more competitive pricing.\nOur aim isn't to compete with the giants in the cloud industry, but simply to finance our ongoing research into privacy-friendly collaboration.\nThere is still much to do, but working together, we can accomplish great things.\n\n","source":"_posts/Funding-CryptPad.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Funding CryptPad\ndate: 2017-04-20 12:15:09\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  -

funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.\n\nSince the [OpenPaaS-NG project](https://open-paas.org/) is only funded until 2019, we've been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.\n\n## Our new funding strategies\n\nMany of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.\n\nWe've chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we're doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe're willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are _willing to pay not to be a product themselves_.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.\n\n### Paid hosting\n\n[CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.\nSo far, this hasn't been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won't be something that we can sustain.\n\nIn many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.\nIn other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.\n\nTo address this problem, we've implemented **pinning**, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, _those which aren't pinned by a registered user_, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.\nWe believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.\n\n* Pinning will only be available to registered users.\n* Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017\n* Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.\n  * new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive\n  * removing a file from your drive's trash will unpin it\n* Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed\n  * effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)\n* Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.\n* For additional storage, you'll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.\n* We'll have more information about pricing soon.\n\n### Support contracts for private installations\n\nIf you've decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.\nLike you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.\n\nIf you're using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.\nWe're still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki's many customers in the past.\nYou can see an example of XWiki's pricing [here](http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise).\n\nIf you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.\nOtherwise, if you find that you're comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you'd like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we'll be there to help.\n\n### Sponsored development of open source features\n\nIf there's a particular feature you'd like to see implemented within CryptPad, we're able to dedicate development time to build it into the software in the best way possible.\n\nSponsored development allows us to build features to suit particular users' needs.\nBy integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.\nThis helps us refine those features to be even more useful for you, and ensures that they will continue to be supported well into the future.\n\n## What's next\n\nSince we announced our [bi-weekly release schedule](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/), we've tried to make sure that each release contains an exciting feature.\nThis time around, we've had to set some time aside to implement pinning, as well as code for reporting the size used by any one user's drive.\nWe realize this isn't especially interesting for most of you, but it will be necessary for some more advanced features which we hope to share with you soon.\n\nBy providing a quota system for our registered users, we will be able to offer encrypted file upload capabilities.\nYou'll be able to upload images, and embed them in presentations and pads, a process which has been somewhat difficult so far.\nOur decision to limit users' upload capacity is intended less to make a profit, and more to limit abuse.\n\nWe recognize that disk space is getting cheaper all the time, and that cloud hosting services will be able to offer more competitive pricing.\nOur aim isn't to compete with the giants in the cloud industry, but simply to finance our ongoing research into privacy-friendly collaboration.\nThere is still much to do, but working together, we can accomplish great things.\n\n","slug":"Funding-CryptPad","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-02T12:16:01.000Z","_id":"cj3fsmc4n0004f4zfyljlez4h","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p>CryptPad

We learned things and improved our security in multiple ways and we have plans to build even further improvements\n3. Update all the things\n\n## Exactly what happened\n\nLate Tuesday night after work, I got an email from Martin Gubri telling me that he had found multiple XSS vulnerabilities in CryptPad.\nThis is not fun news for anybody, but as the browser stores encryption keys, it is especially bad news.\nI want to reiterate what I said in [our first blog post](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/20/Time-to-Encrypt-the-Cloud/ \"Time to Encrypt the Cloud\"), CryptPad is just a regular web app but with provable ethics, it is not designed to provide military grade security.\n\nThough we could have waited until our next release to fix this issue, we decided that we could not feel good working on new features while knowing about an issue which could harm our users.\nHowever, we wanted to fix the systemic issue which caused XSS to be possible in the first place, not just the symptoms which we became aware of.\n\nCryptPad uses a modern web feature called [Content Security Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy) to prevent attacks such as this one.\nContent Security Policy allows a web server to mandate that javascript can only be loaded from domains which are explicitly authorized.\nUnfortunately, CKEditor [makes heavy usage of inline scripts](https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8584) (scripts which are written directly into the HTML file), so we had made an exception for inline script which represents the most common type of XSS.\nWhen Martin did a review of our application, he found multiple places where we had not been properly escaping HTML content and sadly all of these were attackable despite our Content Security Policy.\n\n## How we reacted\n\nFor me, a security bug does not come alone, it is always the result of multiple failures at different levels.\nZero Knowledge is about resilient software for resilient society and we allowed ourselves to rely entirely on proper escaping.\n\nOn Thursday, March 6th, 2017, we deployed and released a set of patches to our previous [Bunyip release](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.0), which we're calling [1.1.1 _Bunyip's Revenge_](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.1).\nThis not only sanitizes XSS in places where we know about but it also implements a strong Content Security Policy everywhere except inside of the CKEditor iframe, which insists on injecting script tags.\n\nIt is important to upgrade as soon as possible because XSS attacks can potentially give an adversary access to all of your pads.\nIf you're using cryptpad.fr on the website then there's nothing you need to do, everything is fixed.\n\n## Moving forward\n\nWe want to find and pioneer better ways of protecting your data on CryptPad.\nWe also hope to foster a whole movement of Zero Knowledge web services which feature layered security, protecting users from external threats as well as the mistakes that developers are sure to make.\n\nSpurred on by the revelation of our own errors, we have reinvigorated a conversation about moving each of the _apps_ such as CKEditor into a [sandboxed iframe](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/) where they would be unable to access any of the cryptographic keys or other pads.\nThis introduces some difficulty on our end, as we want to provide a resilient platform while making Zero Knowledge an approachable subject for web developers.\n\nFinally I would like to also publically thank our friend [_kpcyrd_](https://github.com/kpcyrd) for finding another XSS issue back in early December of 2016, before we had official releases or a blog where we could give him credit for his work.\n\n\n","source":"_posts/Security-growing-pains.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Security growing pains\ndate: 2017-03-06 11:04:58\nauthor: Caleb James Delisle\ntags:\n  - Security\n  - XSS\n---\n\n*Update: The issue mentioned in this blog post was assigned [CVE-2017-1000051](https://github.com/distributedweaknessfiling/DWF-CVE-2017-1000000/blob/f2e15ac3468dd382d9ffa3d5acc032c106f3248c/CVE-2017-1000051.json) by Distributed Weakness Filing, thanks Martin Gubri for applying for the number.*\n\nTo sum things up:\n\n1.

except inside of the CKEditor iframe, which insists on injecting script tags.\n\nIt is important to upgrade as soon as possible because XSS attacks can potentially give an adversary access to all of your pads.\nIf you're using cryptpad.fr on the website then there's nothing you need to do, everything is fixed.\n\n## Moving forward\n\nWe want to find and pioneer better ways of protecting your data on CryptPad.\nWe also hope to foster a whole movement of Zero Knowledge web services which feature layered security, protecting users from external threats as well as the mistakes that developers are sure to make.\n\nSpurred on by the revelation of our own errors, we have reinvigorated a conversation about moving each of the _apps_ such as CKEditor into a [sandboxed iframe](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/) where they would be unable to access any of the cryptographic keys or other pads.\nThis introduces some difficulty on our end, as we want to provide a resilient platform while making Zero Knowledge an approachable subject for web developers.\n\nFinally I would like to also publically thank our friend [_kpcyrd_](https://github.com/kpcyrd) for finding another XSS issue back in early December of 2016, before we had official releases or a blog where we could give him credit for his work.\n\n\n","slug":"Security-growing-pains","published":1,"updated":"2017-06-02T12:16:01.000Z","_id":"cj3fsmc4q0005f4zf5qj666fd","comments":1,"layout":"post","photos":[],"link":"","content":"<p><em>Update:

person's private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.\n\n## How do we know you're secure?\n\nZero Knowledge web apps are not intended to _make you secure_, they're intended to be _provably ethical_.\nThis cannot be overstated, for too long we have been forced to choose between \"James Bond\" security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize

apps can be elegant and usable while still respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we've never collected any data but we can prove we're not doing it systematically.\n\nTo

productive collaboration tool available, and still Zero Knowledge.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to make the CryptPad project [Open Source](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).\nWe did this not only because Open Source is in our culture, but also because we want Zero Knowledge web apps to become the universal standard.\n\n### The plan in four steps\n\n1. Develop the most user friendly collaboration tool available which is also Zero Knowledge.\n2. Use this tool to explain the problem and show that an alternative is possible.\n3. Open Source the work we do so that others can also build Zero Knowledge apps.\n4.

we also want it synced across our computers, tablets, and phones.</p>\n<p>Modern technology allows us to do this, but it does so by sending all our data to <em>the Cloud</em>.</p>\n<p>A lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\"><a href=\"#There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"There is little that one person can do\"></a>There is little that one person can do</h2><p>Terms of service are long, vague documents which usually don’t address knowledge <em>derived</em> from your data.\nMore sinister: you can never really know if they’re cheating.\nAd networks don’t tell you how they know or even what they know.\nThey just show you ads, based on what they discovered about you… <em>somehow</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What’s-your-personal-information-worth\"><a href=\"#What’s-your-personal-information-worth\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What’s your personal information worth?\"></a>What’s your personal information worth?</h2><ul>\n<li>Normally  $0.0005 - $0.0021 per person</li>\n<li>Pregnant in your second trimester? $0.11 (<em>52 times as much</em>)</li>\n<li>Have a specific health condition? $0.26 (<em>123 times as much</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is only going to get worse.\nArtificial Intelligence technology is maturing and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from <em>us</em>, its most valuable products.</p>\n<p>The result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don’t need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> <em>All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public.</em></p>\n<p>–Quinn Norton</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies which don’t <em>extract maximum value</em> from our data will eventually be acquired by those which do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Zero-Knowledge\"><a href=\"#Zero-Knowledge\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Zero Knowledge\"></a>Zero Knowledge</h2><p>Fortunately we don’t have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can make information available across your devices without being able to read the data which it stores.</p>\n<p>We do this by adding a hash character (#) to a link.\nBy design, browsers don’t share anything after this character.\nThat means we can share encryption keys just by sharing links.\nFurthermore, a username and password can be made into a secret key which allows a person’s private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\"><a href=\"#How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do we know you’re secure?\"></a>How do we know you’re secure?</h2><p>Zero Knowledge web apps are not intended to <em>make you secure</em>, they’re intended to be <em>provably ethical</em>.\nThis cannot be overstated, for too long we have been forced to choose between “James Bond” security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize your data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Our promise to you is that our business model is not to spy on you, and it never will be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We hope that the security community will join us in building user-friendly, Zero Knowledge services.\nPrivacy is a social problem as much as it is a mathematical one, and it is time we take that seriously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we’re-going-to-do\"><a href=\"#What-we’re-going-to-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we’re going to do\"></a>What we’re going to do</h2><p>We are going to show the world that web apps can be elegant and usable while still respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we’ve never collected any

Knowledge, the vision and ethics as well as the exact meaning.\n\n* What is Zero Knowledge?\n* How can encryption in the browser be secure?\n* What about metadata?\n* Most importantly: How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge?\n\nI wanted to write a blog post to clarify what Zero Knowledge is all about. Zero Knowledge has two meanings, it can refer to a *Zero Knowledge Proof*, an obscure mathematical construct with few real-world uses but it can also refer to something with a very real-world meaning: web services which encrypt your content so that they themselves cannot read it. You may be wondering how this can be secure when a web administrator can quietly change their site to an unencrypted version at any time. This is a real problem, there is currently no way to verify the content (and code) of a website, but we need not despair. Even though we cannot prove that a website is *secure*, we can check that they are promising to make themselves blind to your content and they make that promise knowing if break it they might get caught.\n\n## Security is probabilistic\n\nConsider the security software you use every day such as your web browser with HTTPS, your phone and your computer's operating system. Have you ever stopped to check that software for \"backdoors\" (intentionally inserted which break your security)? If you have then you are one of the tiny group of heroes who dedicate their time to making the world a bit more robust and I salute you for it. If you're like the rest of us, you just hope that the authors of that software were honest enough and protective enough of their reputations to avoid inserting a backdoor when it means potentially getting caught. Zero Knowledge is based on the same logic, just as software makers can surreptitiously add a backdoor to their software, Zero Knowledge websites can serve a backdoor to the user. However, just as software makers who insert backdoors in their software risk getting caught, Zero Knowledge web app providers who insert backdoors in their website also risk being caught.\n\n## The metadata question\n\nMetadata is a serious issue. Former CIA director Michael Hayden said of the agency: \"We kill people based on metadata\". I don't want to belittle the importance of data which is not the actual content, but at the same time we must recognize that there is a huge uphill climb fix this issue. While the CryptPad project tries not to collect metadata when it can be avoided, we also recognize that other cloud providers may collect more or less metadata than us in order to provide their services. Fundamentally, we accept that a service qualifies as Zero Knowledge as long as the *content* is protected from the server operators. We are committed to studying ways to develop new, more secure solutions to the metadata issue but the spirit of Zero Knowledge is about more ethical solutions which are immediately actionable.\n\n## How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge\n\nZero Knowledge is about trust, nobody can read over and verify all of the code of all of the Zero Knowledge services available, but there are some heuristics which you can use when choosing a service.\n\n### 1. Is it primarily Open Source ?\n\nServices which are primarily Open Source are easier to evaluate both for accidental security mistakes and for potentially nefarious behavior. Furthermore, when a company commits their software to Open Source they make a statement that they are in the business of being an ethical provider for the long term and are not just riding the wave of a popular term.\n\n### 2. Were you warned about losing your password ?\n\nTrue Zero Knowledge services must protect your data from themselves using something you know and they don't, such as your password... In the event that you lose your password and you are using a true Zero Knowledge service, your content will be inaccessible to you and to the service - the locks that keep them out will keep you out as well. Check for this warning.\n\n### 3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?\n\nThis is perhaps the most important question, because when a service provider makes the public statement that they are Zero Knowledge, they show they are prepared to risk their reputation if they are discovered to be storing your content in a way they can access. Some Zero Knowledge providers prefer the term *End-to-end Encrypted* which has gained significant popularity with messaging apps. There is no functional difference between a Zero Knowledge application and one which advertizes End-to-end Encryption.\n\n## Talk to us\n\nCryptPad is developed by a team of 3 people with generous financing from BPIFrance through the [OpenPaaS::NG Research Project](http://ng.open-paas.org/about-us.html). Our mission is to make Cloud Computing more ethical by promoting Zero Knowledge Cloud Services and show young entrepreneurs that it is possible to make a living while being ethical with peoples' data.

Zero Knowledge has two meanings, it can refer to a <em>Zero Knowledge Proof</em>, an obscure mathematical construct with few real-world uses but it can also refer to something with a very real-world meaning: web services which encrypt your content so that they themselves cannot read it. You may be wondering how this can be secure when a web administrator can quietly change their site to an unencrypted version at any time. This is a real problem, there is currently no way to verify the content (and code) of a website, but we need not despair. Even though we cannot prove that a website is <em>secure</em>, we can check that they are promising to make themselves blind to your content and they make that promise knowing if break it they might get caught.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Security-is-probabilistic\"><a href=\"#Security-is-probabilistic\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Security is probabilistic\"></a>Security is probabilistic</h2><p>Consider the security software you use every day such as your web browser with HTTPS, your phone and your computer’s operating system. Have you ever stopped to check that software for “backdoors” (intentionally inserted which break your security)? If you have then you are one of the tiny group of heroes who dedicate their time to making the world a bit more robust and I salute you for it. If you’re like the rest of us, you just hope that the authors of that software were honest enough and protective enough of their reputations to avoid inserting a backdoor when it means potentially getting caught. Zero Knowledge is based on the same logic, just as software makers can surreptitiously add a backdoor to their software, Zero Knowledge websites can serve a backdoor to the user. However, just as software makers who insert backdoors in their software risk getting caught, Zero Knowledge web app providers who insert backdoors in their website also risk being caught.</p>\n<h2 id=\"The-metadata-question\"><a href=\"#The-metadata-question\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The metadata question\"></a>The metadata question</h2><p>Metadata is a serious issue. Former CIA director Michael Hayden said of the agency: “We kill people based on metadata”. I don’t want to belittle the importance of data which is not the actual content, but at the same time we must recognize that there is a huge uphill climb fix this issue. While the CryptPad project tries not to collect metadata when it can be avoided, we also recognize that other cloud providers may collect more or less metadata than us in order to provide their services. Fundamentally, we accept that a service qualifies as Zero Knowledge as long as the <em>content</em> is protected from the server operators. We are committed to studying ways to develop new, more secure solutions to the metadata issue but the spirit of Zero Knowledge is about more ethical solutions which are immediately actionable.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-to-know-if-a-service-is-Zero-Knowledge\"><a href=\"#How-to-know-if-a-service-is-Zero-Knowledge\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge\"></a>How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge</h2><p>Zero Knowledge is about trust, nobody can read over and verify all of the code of all of the Zero Knowledge services available, but there are some heuristics which you can use when choosing a service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1-Is-it-primarily-Open-Source\"><a href=\"#1-Is-it-primarily-Open-Source\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"1.

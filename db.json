changed every part of our lives.\nWe don't just share information with people, but with our various devices, computers, tablets, smartphones, and an increasing number of wearable technologies.\n\nGenerally, when our devices communicate with each other, they do not do so directly, rather, they communicate through _the Cloud_.\nUnfortunately, _the Cloud_ is a fancy way of referring to _other people's computers_.\n\nA lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google, whose main business is knowing _your business_.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.\n\n## There is little a person can do.\n\nTerms of service are long, vague documents which usually don't address knowledge _derived_ from your data.\nMore sinister: you can never really know if they're cheating.\nAd networks don't tell you how they know or even what they know.\nThey just show you ads, based on what they discovered about you... _somehow_.\n\n## What's your personal information worth?\n\n* Normally  $0.0005 - $0.0021 per person\n* Pregnant in your second trimester? $0.11 _52 times as much_\n* Have a specific health condition? $0.26 _123 times as much_\n\nThis is only going to get worse, Artificial Intelligence technology is maturing, and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from _us_, its most valuable products.\n\nThe result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don't need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.\n\n>  All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public.\n>\n> --Quinn Norton\n\nWhile we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies that don't _extract maximum value_ from our data will eventually be acquired by those that do.\n\n## Zero Knowledge\n\nFortunately we don't have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can

respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we've never collected any data but we can prove we're not doing it systematically.\n\nTo start off this conversation, we have developed [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr), the first ever Zero Knowledge Realtime Collaborative Editor.\nWe are aiming to make it the most user friendly, most productive collaboration tool available, and still Zero Knowledge.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to make the CryptPad project [Open Source](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).\nWe did this not only because Open Source is in our culture, but also because we want Zero Knowledge web apps to become the universal standard.\n\n1. Develop the most user friendly collaboration tool available which is also Zero Knowledge.\n2. Use this tool to explain the problem and show that an alternative is possible.\n3.

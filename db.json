problems.\nWe love when this happens because it keeps us from having to reinvent the wheel, leaving more time for unsolved problems.\n\nWhen you try to build something that nobody has built before, however, you run into problems that nobody else cares about.\nWe've had to build a lot of our own components, and some of them have been incredibly complicated.\n\nSome bugs only become obvious under very odd circumstances, when users with different browsers do very specific sequences or combinations of actions.\nOur growing userbase has been critical in helping us to identify these kinds of issues, and things have been improving steadily.\n\n## What we've learned\n\nOur longest delays have come from working on tough problems that managed to get tangled up with smaller bug fixes, which kept them from reaching our users.\nAt the end of 2016, however, most of these big, complicated issues were coming to a close.\nOur team took some much-needed vacation time, and upon returning we started working to release and deploy a tagged version of our codebase.\n\nOur newest features went live to [CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) on Tuesday, the 14th of February.\nSome of them are big enough that we'll probably dedicate entire blog posts to them, but the release notes are [on GitHub](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/1.0.0).\n\n## Our new release policy\n\nIn the interest of getting feedback from our users more quickly, we've decided to adopt a two week release cycle.\nWe're going to focus on delivering features that directly improve your experience.\n\nThe live site will run code from our latest _master_ branch, while the upcoming release will be on the [staging](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/staging) branch.\n\nEach release will come with a set of notes detailing what we did, and known issues that didn't quite make it into that version.\nWe'll work on getting those issues fixed in the following cycle.\n\nWhenever we deploy these big updates, we'll announce when we expect the next one to arrive.\nSince we started on a Tuesday, we expect to deploy again on Tuesday, February the 28th, 2017.\n\n## Codenamed releases\n\nSince it's difficult to remember versions of the software if they have names like `1.0.0`, we've decided to give each one a more memorable codename.\nWith there being 26 letters in the Latin alphabet, and 26 two week releases in the year, we started looking for alphabetical lists from which we could choose names.\nWe didn't look for very long until we thought of _Cryptids_...\n\n> _an animal whose existence or survival is disputed or unsubstantiated, such as the yeti_\n\nWe quickly settled on picking a name from this list every two weeks, starting with the letter A, and proceding through the alphabet.\nFor version `1.0.0`, we went with [Agogwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agogwe).\n\nThere won't necessarily be much significance to the name we choose, but we hope that nobody will worry if we choose a particularly frightening cryptid for a given release.\nSome of the code is bound to be difficult and scary to write, but we want your experience to be _as easy as possible_.\n\nAs always, if you have any feedback you'd like to share, we want to hear it!\n[Contact us](https://cryptpad.fr/contact.html) and let us know how you use Cryptpad.\n\nIf you aren't using CryptPad yet, give it a try at

before we had official releases or a blog where we could give him credit for his work.</p>\n","excerpt":"","more":"<p>To sum things up:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Framartin\">Martin Gubri</a> volunteered to help us with security testing and found multiple XSS vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>We learned things and improved our security in multiple ways and we have plans to build even further improvements</li>\n<li>Update all the things</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Exactly-what-happened\"><a href=\"#Exactly-what-happened\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Exactly what happened\"></a>Exactly what happened</h2><p>Late Tuesday night after work, I got an email from Martin Gubri telling me that he had found multiple XSS vulnerabilities in CryptPad.\nThis is not fun news for anybody, but as the browser stores encryption keys, it is especially bad news.\nI want to reiterate what I said in <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/20/Time-to-Encrypt-the-Cloud/\" title=\"Time to Encrypt the Cloud\">our first blog post</a>, CryptPad is just a regular web app but with provable ethics, it is not designed to provide military grade security.</p>\n<p>Though we could have waited until our next release to fix this issue, we decided that we could not feel good working on new features while knowing about an issue which could harm our users.\nHowever, we wanted to fix the systemic issue which caused XSS to be possible in the first place, not just the symptoms which we became aware of.</p>\n<p>CryptPad uses a modern web feature called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy\">Content Security Policy</a> to prevent attacks such as this one.\nContent Security Policy allows a web server to mandate that javascript can only be loaded from domains which are explicitly authorized.\nUnfortunately, CKEditor <a href=\"https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8584\">makes heavy usage of inline scripts</a> (scripts which are written directly into the HTML file), so we had made an exception for inline script which represents the most common type of XSS.\nWhen Martin did a review of our application, he found multiple places where we had not been properly escaping HTML content and sadly all of these were attackable despite our Content Security Policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-we-reacted\"><a href=\"#How-we-reacted\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How we reacted\"></a>How we reacted</h2><p>For me, a security bug does not come alone, it is always the result of multiple failures at different levels.\nZero Knowledge is about resilient software for resilient society and we allowed ourselves to rely entirely on proper escaping.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, March 6th, 2017, we deployed and released a set of patches to our previous <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.0\">Bunyip release</a>, which we’re calling <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.1\">1.1.1 <em>Bunyip’s Revenge</em></a>.\nThis not only sanitizes XSS in places where we know about but it also implements a strong Content Security Policy everywhere except inside of the CKEditor iframe, which insists on injecting script tags.</p>\n<p>It is important to upgrade as soon as possible because XSS attacks can potentially give an adversary access to all of your pads.\nIf you’re using cryptpad.fr on the website then there’s nothing you need to do, everything is fixed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Moving-forward\"><a href=\"#Moving-forward\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Moving forward\"></a>Moving forward</h2><p>We want to find and pioneer better ways of protecting your data on CryptPad.\nWe also hope to foster a whole movement of Zero Knowledge web services which feature layered security, protecting users from external threats as well as the mistakes that developers are sure to make.</p>\n<p>Spurred on by the revelation of our own errors, we have reinvigorated a conversation about moving each of the <em>apps</em> such as CKEditor into a <a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/\">sandboxed iframe</a> where they would be unable to access any of the cryptographic keys or other pads.\nThis introduces some difficulty on our end, as we want to provide a resilient platform while making Zero Knowledge an approachable subject for web developers.</p>\n<p>Finally I would like to also publically thank our friend <a href=\"https://github.com/kpcyrd\"><em>kpcyrd</em></a> for finding another XSS issue back in early December of 2016, before we had official releases or a blog where we could give him credit for his work.</p>\n"},{"title":"Time to Encrypt the Cloud","date":"2017-02-20T16:54:02.000Z","author":"Caleb James DeLisle","_content":"\nFrom typing a business letter to taking pictures with friends, the internet has changed every part of our lives.\nWe don't just share information with people, we also want it synced across our computers, tablets, and phones.\n\nModern technology allows us to do this, but it does so by sending all our data to _the Cloud_.\n\nA lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.\n\n## There is little that one person can do\n\nTerms of service are long, vague documents which usually don't address knowledge _derived_ from your data.\nMore sinister: you can never really know if they're cheating.\nAd networks don't tell you how they know or even what they know.\nThey just show you ads, based on what they discovered about you... _somehow_.\n\n## What's your personal information worth?\n\n* Normally  $0.0005 - $0.0021 per person\n* Pregnant in your second trimester? $0.11 (_52 times as much_)\n* Have a specific health condition? $0.26 (_123 times as much_)\n\nThis is only going to get worse.\nArtificial Intelligence technology is maturing and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from _us_, its most valuable products.\n\nThe result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don't need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.\n\n>  _All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public._\n>\n> --Quinn Norton\n\nWhile we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies which don't _extract maximum value_ from our data will eventually be acquired by those which do.\n\n## Zero Knowledge\n\nFortunately we don't have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can make information available across your devices without being able to read the data which it stores.\n\nWe do this by adding a hash character (#) to a link.\nBy design, browsers don't share anything after this character.\nThat means we can share encryption keys just by sharing links.\nFurthermore, a username and password can be made into a secret key which allows a person's private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.\n\n## How do we know you're secure?\n\nZero Knowledge web apps are not intended to _make you secure_, they're intended to be _provably ethical_.\nThis cannot be overstated, for too long we have been forced to choose between \"James Bond\" security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize your data.\n\n> _Our promise to you is that our business model is not to spy on you, and it never will be_.\n\nWe hope that the security community will join us in building user-friendly, Zero Knowledge services.\nPrivacy is a social problem as much as it is a mathematical one, and it is time we take that seriously.\n\n## What we're going to do\n\nWe are going to show the world that web apps can be elegant and usable while still respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we've never collected any data but we can prove we're not doing it systematically.\n\nTo start off this conversation, we have developed [CryptPad](https://cryptpad.fr), the first ever Zero Knowledge Realtime Collaborative Editor.\nWe are aiming to make it the most user friendly, most productive collaboration tool available, and still Zero Knowledge.\n\nFinally, we have chosen to make the CryptPad project [Open Source](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad).\nWe did this not only because Open Source is in our culture, but also because we want Zero Knowledge web apps to become the universal standard.\n\n### The plan in four steps\n\n1. Develop the most user friendly collaboration tool available which is also Zero Knowledge.\n2. Use this tool to explain the problem and show that an alternative is possible.\n3. Open Source the work we do so that others can also build Zero Knowledge apps.\n4. Foster a culture where privacy by default is a baseline expectation.\n\n## How you can help\n\n* Use CryptPad and other Zero Knowledge services evey day, tell us what you like and what we can do better.\n* Show your support: Buy an upgraded account (_coming soon_) from us, the people who are developing the code.\n* If you install the Open Source code of CryptPad on your own servers, consider buying a support contract.\n* Talk to your friends and colleagues about Zero Knowledge, show them CryptPad and explain that this is what the cloud can be.\n* If you're a web developer, think about Zero Knowledge for your next web app.\n\n## Other Zero Knowledge Services\n\n### Open Source\n\n* Sync backups to Google or Dropbox and force them to become Zero Knowledge\n  * https://cryptomator.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator\n* Easy chrome extension for gmail users to send & receive end-to-end encrypted email\n  * https://cryptup.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/tomholub/cryptup-chrome\n* Send and receive end-to-end encrypted email using your normal email account (Mobile, Desktop version coming soon)\n  * https://prettyeasyprivacy.com/\n  * https://cacert.pep.foundation/trac\n* Send end-to-end encrypted text messages on your phone\n  * https://whispersystems.org/\n  * Source Code: https://github.com/whispersystems\n* Type or paste a message and give the link to friends\n  * https://ncry.pt/  (Source code: https://github.com/luggs-co/ncrypt)\n  * https://privatebin.net/ (Source code: https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin)\n* Chat online with lots of people at once\n  * https://riot.im/  **NOTE:** End-to-end encryption mode in beta so currently disabled by default\n  * Source code: https://github.com/vector-im\n\n### Proprietary\n\nWhile we value Open Source, the need for Zero Knowledge Cloud is paramount and we respect the\ndecision of some organizations to keep parts of their codebases proprietary.\n\n* Data backup\n  * https://www.boxcryptor.com/en\n  * https://whisp.ly/en\n  * https://www.sync.com/\n  * https://www.pcloud.com\n  * https://spideroak.com/personal/spideroak-one\n* Chat and instant messaging\n  * https://wire.com/en/\n  * https://spideroak.com/personal/semaphor\n* Send and receive end-to-end encrypted email\n  * https://protonmail.com/\n* Web of trust and proof of identity\n  * https://keybase.io/\n\n\nAn important one which we forgot?

we also want it synced across our computers, tablets, and phones.</p>\n<p>Modern technology allows us to do this, but it does so by sending all our data to <em>the Cloud</em>.</p>\n<p>A lot of what we think of as the Cloud is owned by multinational corporations like Google.\nThough they may seem like innocent custodians of our data, behind the scenes they are often using it to target us with advertising.</p>\n<h2 id=\"There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\"><a href=\"#There-is-little-that-one-person-can-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"There is little that one person can do\"></a>There is little that one person can do</h2><p>Terms of service are long, vague documents which usually don’t address knowledge <em>derived</em> from your data.\nMore sinister: you can never really know if they’re cheating.\nAd networks don’t tell you how they know or even what they know.\nThey just show you ads, based on what they discovered about you… <em>somehow</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What’s-your-personal-information-worth\"><a href=\"#What’s-your-personal-information-worth\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What’s your personal information worth?\"></a>What’s your personal information worth?</h2><ul>\n<li>Normally  $0.0005 - $0.0021 per person</li>\n<li>Pregnant in your second trimester? $0.11 (<em>52 times as much</em>)</li>\n<li>Have a specific health condition? $0.26 (<em>123 times as much</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is only going to get worse.\nArtificial Intelligence technology is maturing and Silicon Valley is using it to derive even more value from <em>us</em>, its most valuable products.</p>\n<p>The result of this will be a veritable weapon of mass manipulation.\nThe tragedy is, manipulating people to get what you want is not that complex.\nWe don’t need to wait for the AI singularity, all we need is a deep mind with the cleverness of a spoiled 5 year old.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> <em>All data, over time, approaches deleted, or public.</em></p>\n<p>–Quinn Norton</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While we must seek to use services with ethical foundations, we must also recognize that once we give up our data, we are at the mercy of economics.\nCompanies which don’t <em>extract maximum value</em> from our data will eventually be acquired by those which do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Zero-Knowledge\"><a href=\"#Zero-Knowledge\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Zero Knowledge\"></a>Zero Knowledge</h2><p>Fortunately we don’t have to go back to the typewriter age.\nUsing basic cryptography, the cloud can make information available across your devices without being able to read the data which it stores.</p>\n<p>We do this by adding a hash character (#) to a link.\nBy design, browsers don’t share anything after this character.\nThat means we can share encryption keys just by sharing links.\nFurthermore, a username and password can be made into a secret key which allows a person’s private data to be kept encrypted using their login credentials.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\"><a href=\"#How-do-we-know-you’re-secure\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How do we know you’re secure?\"></a>How do we know you’re secure?</h2><p>Zero Knowledge web apps are not intended to <em>make you secure</em>, they’re intended to be <em>provably ethical</em>.\nThis cannot be overstated, for too long we have been forced to choose between “James Bond” security protocols which are too difficult to use, and slick web apps which monetize your data.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Our promise to you is that our business model is not to spy on you, and it never will be</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We hope that the security community will join us in building user-friendly, Zero Knowledge services.\nPrivacy is a social problem as much as it is a mathematical one, and it is time we take that seriously.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-we’re-going-to-do\"><a href=\"#What-we’re-going-to-do\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What we’re going to do\"></a>What we’re going to do</h2><p>We are going to show the world that web apps can be elegant and usable while still respecting privacy in a verifiable way.\nWe cannot easily prove that we’ve never collected any data but we can prove we’re not doing it systematically.</p>\n<p>To start off this conversation, we have developed <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr\">CryptPad</a>, the first ever Zero Knowledge Realtime Collaborative Editor.\nWe are aiming to make it the most user friendly, most productive collaboration tool available, and still Zero Knowledge.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have chosen to make the CryptPad project <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad\">Open Source</a>.\nWe did this not only because Open Source is in our culture, but also because we want Zero Knowledge web apps to become the universal standard.</p>\n<h3 id=\"The-plan-in-four-steps\"><a href=\"#The-plan-in-four-steps\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"The plan in four steps\"></a>The plan in four steps</h3><ol>\n<li>Develop

Knowledge, the vision and ethics as well as the exact meaning.\n\n* What is Zero Knowledge?\n* How can encryption in the browser be secure?\n* What about metadata?\n* Most importantly: How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge?\n\nI wanted to write a blog post to clarify what Zero Knowledge is all about. Zero Knowledge has two meanings, it can refer to a *Zero Knowledge Proof*, an obscure mathematical construct with few real-world uses but it can also refer to something with a very real-world meaning: web services which encrypt your content so that they themselves cannot read it. You may be wondering how this can be secure when a web administrator can quietly change their site to an unencrypted version at any time. This is a real problem, there is currently no way to verify the content (and code) of a website, but we need not despair. Even though we cannot prove that a website is *secure*, we can check that they are promising to make themselves blind to your content and they make that promise knowing if break it they might get caught.\n\n## Security is probabilistic\n\nConsider the security software you use every day such as your web browser with HTTPS, your phone and your computer's operating system. Have you ever stopped to check that software for \"backdoors\" (intentionally inserted which break your security)? If you have then you are one of the tiny group of heroes who dedicate their time to making the world a bit more robust and I salute you for it. If you're like the rest of us, you just hope that the authors of that software were honest enough and protective enough of their reputations to avoid inserting a backdoor when it means potentially getting caught. Zero Knowledge is based on the same logic, just as software makers can surreptitiously add a backdoor to their software, Zero Knowledge websites can serve a backdoor to the user. However, just as software makers who insert backdoors in their software risk getting caught, Zero Knowledge web app providers who insert backdoors in their website also risk being caught.\n\n## The metadata question\n\nMetadata is a serious issue. Former CIA director Michael Hayden said of the agency: \"We kill people based on metadata\". I don't want to belittle the importance of data which is not the actual content, but at the same time we must recognize that there is a huge uphill climb fix this issue. While the CryptPad project tries not to collect metadata when it can be avoided, we also recognize that other cloud providers may collect more or less metadata than us in order to provide their services. Fundamentally, we accept that a service qualifies as Zero Knowledge as long as the *content* is protected from the server operators. We are committed to studying ways to develop new, more secure solutions to the metadata issue but the spirit of Zero Knowledge is about more ethical solutions which are immediately actionable.\n\n## How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge\n\nZero Knowledge is about trust, nobody can read over and verify all of the code of all of the Zero Knowledge services available, but there are some heuristics which you can use when choosing a service.\n\n### 1. Is it primarily Open Source ?\n\nServices which are primarily Open Source are easier to evaluate both for accidental security mistakes and for potentially nefarious behavior. Furthermore, when a company commits their software to Open Source they make a statement that they are in the business of being an ethical provider for the long term and are not just riding the wave of a popular term.\n\n### 2. Were you warned about losing your password ?\n\nTrue Zero Knowledge services must protect your data from themselves using something you know and they don't, such as your password... In the event that you lose your password and you are using a true Zero Knowledge service, your content will be inaccessible to you and to the service - the locks that keep them out will keep you out as well. Check for this warning.\n\n### 3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?\n\nThis is perhaps the most important question, because when a service provider makes the public statement that they are Zero Knowledge, they show they are prepared to risk their reputation if they are discovered to be storing your content in a way they can access. Some Zero Knowledge providers prefer the term *End-to-end Encrypted* which has gained significant popularity with messaging apps. There is no functional difference between a Zero Knowledge application and one which advertizes End-to-end Encryption.\n\n## Talk to us\n\nCryptPad is developed by a team of 3 people with generous financing from BPIFrance through the [OpenPaaS::NG Research Project](http://ng.open-paas.org/about-us.html). Our mission is to make Cloud Computing more ethical by promoting Zero Knowledge Cloud Services and show young entrepreneurs that it is possible to make a living while being ethical with peoples' data.

Furthermore, when a company commits their software to Open Source they make a statement that they are in the business of being an ethical provider for the long term and are not just riding the wave of a popular term.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-Were-you-warned-about-losing-your-password\"><a href=\"#2-Were-you-warned-about-losing-your-password\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"2. Were you warned about losing your password ?\"></a>2. Were you warned about losing your password ?</h3><p>True Zero Knowledge services must protect your data from themselves using something you know and they don’t, such as your password… In the event that you lose your password and you are using a true Zero Knowledge service, your content will be inaccessible to you and to the service - the locks that keep them out will keep you out as well. Check for this warning.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-Does-it-claim-to-be-Zero-Knowledge-or-End-to-end-Encrypted\"><a href=\"#3-Does-it-claim-to-be-Zero-Knowledge-or-End-to-end-Encrypted\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?\"></a>3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?</h3><p>This is perhaps the most important question, because when a service provider makes the public statement that they are Zero Knowledge, they show they are prepared to risk their reputation if they are discovered to be storing your content in a way they can access. Some Zero Knowledge providers prefer the term <em>End-to-end Encrypted</em> which has gained significant popularity with messaging apps. There is no functional difference between a Zero Knowledge application and one which advertizes End-to-end Encryption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Talk-to-us\"><a href=\"#Talk-to-us\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Talk to us\"></a>Talk to us</h2><p>CryptPad is developed by a team of 3 people with generous financing from BPIFrance through the <a href=\"http://ng.open-paas.org/about-us.html\">OpenPaaS::NG Research Project</a>.

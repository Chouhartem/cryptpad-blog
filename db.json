features\nwhich we've been working on for a long time. As part of the\n[UCF project](https://github.com/UCF-project) we have implemented a Zero Knowledge\n`media-tag` in CryptPad for displaying and downloading encrypted files stored in\nCryptPad. Starting now, you can upload files by clicking the upload button or\ndragging them into your CryptDrive.

MacSween","_content":"\nWhen I joined the research team at [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.com/en/team/) a little over a year ago, CryptPad was very much an experiment.\nWe had ideas of what we wanted to accomplish, but we didn't know whether it would work at all, let alone how we were going to get there.\n\nWe've come a long way since then.\nHaving proven that _zero knowledge, real time collaborative editing_ in the browser was possible, we've been thinking about an even more difficult task:\n\n> How do we make this something that _anybody_ can use?\n\n## How we've gotten here\n\nWe've built CryptPad from a number of small pieces.\nIn some cases, we were lucky enough to find existing software libraries which solved our problems.\nWe love when this happens because it keeps us from having to reinvent the wheel, leaving more time for unsolved problems.\n\nWhen you try to build something that nobody has built before, however, you run into problems that nobody else cares about.\nWe've had to build a lot of our own components, and some of them have been incredibly complicated.\n\nSome bugs only become obvious under very odd circumstances, when users with different browsers do very specific sequences or combinations of actions.\nOur growing userbase has been critical in helping us to identify these kinds of issues, and things have been improving steadily.\n\n## What we've learned\n\nOur longest delays have come from working on tough problems that managed to get tangled up with smaller bug fixes, which kept them from reaching our users.\nAt the end of 2016, however, most of these big, complicated issues were coming to a close.\nOur team took some much-needed vacation time, and upon returning we started working to release and deploy a tagged version of our

we started on a Tuesday, we expect to deploy again on Tuesday, February the 28th, 2017.\n\n## Codenamed releases\n\nSince it's difficult to remember versions of the software if they have names like `1.0.0`, we've decided to give each one a more memorable codename.\nWith there being 26 letters in the Latin alphabet, and 26 two week releases in the year, we started looking for alphabetical lists from which we could choose names.\nWe didn't look for very long until we thought of _Cryptids_...\n\n> _an animal whose existence or survival is disputed or unsubstantiated, such as the yeti_\n\nWe

\n*People hosting instances of CryptPad should read at least the\n[Changes in CryptPad](/2017/06/02/Building-mutually-beneficial-relationships/#Changes-in-CryptPad)\nsection*\n \n*Thanks to Scott Alexander for some of the\n[ethical foundations](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)\nof this post.*\n \n---\n \nYou ever wonder why Open Source software always seems to be slightly harder\nto use and slightly buggier and slightly less *polished* than proprietary\ncompetitors?\n \nHow about this: Why is it that good people who want to make good things somehow\nend up making evil things for evil corporations which sell them to other good\npeople who would (presumably) rather buy good things.\n\n\n## It's all about incentives\n \nIt's hard to talk about incentives without sounding like a miserly tool, but if\nwe're going to hack ourselves out of a situation that nobody really wants to be in,\nwe're going to need to understand them pretty well.\n \n* Why is Open Source habitually *90% of the way there* ?\n* Why is Facebook more addictive than it is useful ?\n* Why is it that when you get something for free, even from a well funded\ngovernment program, it's reliably worse than something you buy?\n \nIt's all about incentives.\n \n### In a restaurant, you're the customer\n \nI love going to restaurants. I have no car and few possessions so restaurants are\nthe way I spend my income. Not only do I love food but I love the relationship\nwhich I have with restaurateurs.

Soup kitchens, however, are not\nrestaurants.

If, however, you want to keep your CryptPad instance\ncompletely  hidden from us, you can set this parameter to <strong>false</strong> and it will\nnever query the account server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Coming-next\"><a href=\"#Coming-next\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Coming next\"></a>Coming next</h2><p>Our objective is to help you collaborate, stay organized and get things done\nfaster and easier. We want to provide maximum value to you and we want you to\nprovide value to us so that we can continue doing it.

We have been able to develop this project with the generous support of [BPI France](http://www.bpifrance.fr/) and the [OpenPaaS::NG](http://ng.open-paas.org/) but that support only finances a small team and it will not continue indefinitely.\n\nStarting with this release, we are adopting a new look and a reinforced dedication to making a quality product for people whose time is valuable.

CryptPad is finally something that I'm starting to feel proud of, and the logo represented the last reminents of a time when everything was a rush and quality was an afterthought.\n\nWe also have introduced a lot of new features such as:\n* New front page which allows creating a pad in 1 click\n* Clickable links in pads when viewed in read-only mode\n* File-picker for embedding media in a pad in Markdown mode\n* You can now have your preference between tabs and spaces, when editing in the code editor\n\n![Registered users can uploading and view PDF Files](/images/cryptpad_pdf.png)\n\nBut more than features, we have focused on making CryptPad easier to use.

Moving the visual content to a different domain means that even in the event of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting\">Cross-site scripting</a> security vulnerability, most of your private information such as the pads in your CryptDrive, will not be at risk.</p>\n<p>In this version we updated only the /pad/ application to use the cross-domain iframe because it is the only app which requires <em>inline script</em>. This prevented us from using Content Security Policy to block the most significant vector for Cross Site Scripting attacks but now with the cross-domain iframe, such attacks are mitigated.</p>\n<p><media-tag src=\"https://files.cryptpad.fr/blob/b5/b5cd676935a5b23c158f38a84b7f3dfd3dc96ab3aafddd62\" data-crypto-key=\"cryptpad:FBD19VUsNtgIxwjMGSOZcswciQzDixfuBY7dVWVwRG0=\" data-attr-width=\"50%\"></media-tag></p>\n<p>Going forward, we plan to implement a standardized CryptPad application API so that new applications can be developed, installed and used in CryptPad. Today, the CryptPad API which is exposed to apps such as /pad/ and /code/ is not standardized and there is no clear line between the apps themselves and the CryptPad internals. As we move toward the a standard app API, we will define a standard representation of a CryptPad application with such additional aspects as the app’s color-scheme and icons.</p>\n<p>Fundimentally, this unexciting change to CryptPad begins a new phase in development, we plan to move from a set of integrated prepackaged applications to an ecosystem of applications for collaborating on different types of content with the same encryption under the hood.</p>\n<h2 id=\"But-Wait-There’s-more\"><a href=\"#But-Wait-There’s-more\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"But Wait, There’s more\"></a>But Wait, There’s more</h2><p>The pictures in this blog post are not hosted on the blog, they are in fact Zero Knowledge files uploaded on CryptPad.

MacSween","_content":"\nCryptPad started as a novel idea:\n\n> provide a means for people to collaborate on the web, without their data being exposed to the server that connects them\n\nSince its conception as one developer's hobby project, this idea has grown organically into a team of core developers, a community of contributors, and a growing number of people who collaborate with CryptPad every day.\n\n## How we're able to do this work\n\nCryptPad is a part of the OpenPaaS-NG project, which is funded by [BPIFrance](http://www.bpifrance.fr/).\nAs mentioned in [our April 1st post](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/04/01/Exciting-news/), this funding only applies to 50% of our expenses.\nI joked that the other 50% was being covered by our new partners (the _**NSA**_), but in fact, the remainder is still covered entirely by [XWiki SAS](http://xwiki.com).\n\nWe have a fair amount of autonomy when it comes to deciding what features we will develop.\nWith that in mind, however, there are some long term goals that come as a part of OpenPaaS, some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.\n\nWe recognize that however people's goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.\n\nBy operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we're able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.\nOur ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.\n\nSince the [OpenPaaS-NG project](https://open-paas.org/) is only funded until 2019, we've been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.\n\n## Our new funding strategies\n\nMany of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.\n\nWe've chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we're doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe're willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are _willing to pay not to be a product themselves_.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.\n\n### Paid hosting\n\n[CryptPad.fr](https://cryptpad.fr) hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.\nSo far, this hasn't been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won't be something that we can sustain.\n\nIn many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.\nIn other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.\n\nTo address this problem, we've implemented **pinning**, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, _those which aren't pinned by a registered user_, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.\nWe believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.\n\n* Pinning will only be available to registered users.\n* Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017\n* Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.\n  * new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive\n  * removing a file from your drive's trash will unpin it\n* Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed\n  * effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)\n* Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.\n* For additional storage, you'll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.\n* We'll have more information about pricing soon.\n\n### Support contracts for private installations\n\nIf you've decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.\nLike you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.\n\nIf you're using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.\nWe're still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki's many customers in the past.\nYou can see an example of XWiki's pricing [here](http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise).\n\nIf you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.\nOtherwise, if you find that you're comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you'd like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we'll be there to help.\n\n### Sponsored development of open source features\n\nIf there's a particular feature you'd like to see implemented within CryptPad, we're able to dedicate development time to build it into the software in the best way possible.\n\nSponsored development allows us to build features to suit particular users' needs.\nBy integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.\nThis helps us refine those features to be even more useful for you, and ensures that they will continue to be supported well into the future.\n\n## What's next\n\nSince we announced our [bi-weekly release schedule](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/), we've tried to make sure that each release contains an exciting feature.\nThis time around, we've had to set some time aside to implement pinning, as well as code for reporting the size used by any one user's drive.\nWe realize this isn't especially interesting for most of you, but it will be necessary for some more advanced features which we hope to share with you soon.\n\nBy providing a quota system for our registered users, we will be able to offer encrypted file upload capabilities.\nYou'll be able to upload images, and embed them in presentations and pads, a process which has been somewhat difficult so far.\nOur decision to limit users' upload capacity is intended less to make a profit, and more to limit abuse.\n\nWe recognize that disk space is getting cheaper all the time, and that cloud hosting services will be able to offer more competitive pricing.\nOur aim isn't to compete with the giants in the cloud industry, but simply to finance our ongoing research into privacy-friendly collaboration.\nThere is still much to do, but working together, we can accomplish great things.\n\n","source":"_posts/Funding-CryptPad.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Funding CryptPad\ndate: 2017-04-20 12:15:09\nauthor: Aaron MacSween\ntags:\n  -

idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>provide a means for people to collaborate on the web, without their data being exposed to the server that connects them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since its conception as one developer’s hobby project, this idea has grown organically into a team of core developers, a community of contributors, and a growing number of people who collaborate with CryptPad every day.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-we’re-able-to-do-this-work\"><a href=\"#How-we’re-able-to-do-this-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How we’re able to do this work\"></a>How we’re able to do this work</h2><p>CryptPad is a part of the OpenPaaS-NG project, which is funded by <a href=\"http://www.bpifrance.fr/\">BPIFrance</a>.\nAs mentioned in <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/04/01/Exciting-news/\">our April 1st post</a>, this funding only applies to 50% of our expenses.\nI joked that the other 50% was being covered by our new partners (the <em><strong>NSA</strong></em>), but in fact, the remainder is still covered entirely by <a href=\"http://xwiki.com\">XWiki SAS</a>.</p>\n<p>We have a fair amount of autonomy when it comes to deciding what features we will develop.\nWith that in mind, however, there are some long term goals that come as a part of OpenPaaS, some that stem from XWiki, and some that come from feedback from our userbase.</p>\n<p>We recognize that however people’s goals may differ, ultimately everyone with an interest in the project would like to see it continue to receive attention.</p>\n<p>By operating as part of an established company that has a history of building open source software, we’re able to leverage experience and resources that would not be as readily available if we were to attempt to build the same thing in our free time.\nOur ability to solicit research funding means that individuals who wish to see the project prosper are not solely responsible for its livelihood.</p>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://open-paas.org/\">OpenPaaS-NG project</a> is only funded until 2019, we’ve been searching for other means of funding.\nUntil 2019, any additional revenue would serve to ease the load on our employer.\nWe hope that by the time the project finishes, we will have solidified a stream of income which is stable enough to make CryptPad entirely self-sustaining.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Our-new-funding-strategies\"><a href=\"#Our-new-funding-strategies\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Our new funding strategies\"></a>Our new funding strategies</h2><p>Many of the largest web companies operate by offering free services to anyone who wants to use them.\nThey offset the costs of these services by selling user data to whoever will buy it, or by selling ad space to anyone who wants to sell to their market.</p>\n<p>We’ve chosen not to pursue either of these options.\nInstead, we want to appeal to those who value the work we’re doing, and provide options for supporting it, so that we can continue to improve CryptPad.\nWe’re willing to bet on a trend that other privacy-conscious enterprises have demonstrated, that people are <em>willing to pay not to be a product themselves</em>.</p>\n<p>To be perfectly clear, we will continue to develop our code in the open.\nAnybody who wants to install CryptPad for themselves will still be able to do so.\nAdditionally, the features CryptPad now offers will continue to be available under the current terms.\nGoing forward, however, we will offer certain additional functionality as premium features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Paid-hosting\"><a href=\"#Paid-hosting\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Paid hosting\"></a>Paid hosting</h3><p><a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr\">CryptPad.fr</a> hosts an ever-increasing amount of data.\nSo far, this hasn’t been a concern, but as more people take interest in the project this won’t be something that we can sustain.</p>\n<p>In many cases, people create a pad as a test of the software, and forget about it once they understand how things work.\nIn other situations, people use CryptPad to collaborate on reports, code, or presentations.\nAt some point, those projects are finished, and those documents are forgotten.</p>\n<p>To address this problem, we’ve implemented <strong>pinning</strong>, which is a way of telling the server that you want a pad to continue to be available.\nAnonymous pads, that is, <em>those which aren’t pinned by a registered user</em>, are liable to be removed after 90 days of not having been read or modified.\nWe believe this time is sufficient to distinguish valuable information from that which is safe to remove.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pinning will only be available to registered users.</li>\n<li>Pinning will take effect following our next release, on April 25th, 2017</li>\n<li>Everything that is in your drive will be automatically pinned.<ul>\n<li>new files will be pinned once you add them to your drive</li>\n<li>removing a file from your drive’s trash will unpin it</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Unpinned files which have not been accessed for at least 90 days will be removed<ul>\n<li>effective July 24th, 2017 (90 days from April 25th)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Registration is free, but we plan to offer users a limited amount of storage space for pinning.</li>\n<li>For additional storage, you’ll have the option of paying a modest fee for an increased quota.</li>\n<li>We’ll have more information about pricing soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Support-contracts-for-private-installations\"><a href=\"#Support-contracts-for-private-installations\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Support contracts for private installations\"></a>Support contracts for private installations</h3><p>If you’ve decided to host CryptPad yourself, we fully understand.\nLike you, we use free software, and know the benefits of taking responsibility for your own infrastructure.</p>\n<p>If you’re using CryptPad to host critical information, however, you might consider purchasing a support contract.\nWe’re still figuring out the details of our support contracts, however, this approach has proven to be of valuable to XWiki’s many customers in the past.\nYou can see an example of XWiki’s pricing <a href=\"http://www.xwiki.com/en/products/pricing-onpremise\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>If you plan to use CryptPad for your business, consider that it might be more time and cost effective to have us install and configure everything than to learn to administrate it on your own.\nOtherwise, if you find that you’re comfortable setting everything up in a basic configuration, but you’d like help configuring your server to behave in a special way, we’ll be there to help.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Sponsored-development-of-open-source-features\"><a href=\"#Sponsored-development-of-open-source-features\"

needs.\nBy integrating those features into the official, open source version of CryptPad, we ensure that they will be used by as many people as possible.\nThis helps us refine those features to be

ServiceWorker","date":"2018-06-22T19:21:58.000Z","author":"Caleb James DeLisle","_content":"\nWhen CryptPad was first created, the only thing to load was the CryptPad code itself and the pad which you were editing. Recently edited pads were remembered in the browser's [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) which was not portable between computers but allowed some recent history to be kept.\n\nHowever, we wanted to allow people to login and manage their pads on all of their devices so we created the CryptDrive. Anyone who has used CryptPad but never logged in is encouraged to [register and login](https://cryptpad.fr/register) (it's free) and check out their drive. CryptDrive is basically just a realtime pad containing a JSON structure with links to all of your pads as well as their titles and other information. When you update the title of a pad, it changes the pad itself but it also changes your drive so that you can see the title of the pad in your drive. This is of course not perfect because if someone else changes the title of a pad, your drive will not be updated until you look at the pad again, but doing everything with the server completely blind to the content isn't easy, and this works reasonably well.\n\nHowever, CryptDrive causes an additional delay when loading CryptPad because whenever you load a document, you are actually loading two realtime instances. Since the drive is loaded over and over for every pad you view, it was obvious to us that we could make it more efficient using communication inside the browser.\n\n## First idea: Messages between tabs\n\nTabs (or windows) in a browser which are on the same website are able to [communicate using localStorage](http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Using-Local-Storage-as-a-communication-channel) and so it seemed like a good solution to just have one tab claim the role of managing the drive and then when another tab is opened, it would message the first. However, this seemingly easy solution becomes a nightmare when you consider what happens when that tab is closed. The drive that everyone is relying on goes away and all of the other tabs are without a drive so they need to [flip a coin](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html) to decide which tab should become the keeper of the drive, then that tab needs to download the drive before it can service events, all the while any of the buttons which affect the drive (for instance deleting the pad) cannot possibly function. This idea was soon scrapped...\n\n## Enter ServiceWorker\nRecently, the HTML5 working group created a new standard called [ServiceWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker) which for someone making a webapp seems like a dream come true. ServiceWorkers:\n\n* Are side-processes which are created one-per-website and live in the background.\n* Can intercept HTTP requests from your main javascript (excellent for caching!).\n* Is suspended when the last tab is closed, and re-launched when the user returns.\n* Are stored in suspended state even when the browser is turned off.\n* Supported by [every modern browser](https://caniuse.com/#search=serviceworker).\n\nWhen the website loads a worker, if the worker is already running it will not load and will instead defer to the existing worker. Communicating between workers and tabs which are on the website is possible via a [postMessage()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage) API and then the ServiceWorker can postMessage() which will reach all tabs that are navigated to the website.\n\nOne limitation of this design is versioning. Because the ServiceWorker would stay alive potentially forever, we needed to identify a way to upgrade it if a new version of CryptPad is released. This is quite important for CryptPad as version mismatches can lead to catastrophic conflicts between different browsers working on the same document.\n\nThough updating is non-trivial, we were able to solve it by sending version messages between different components of CryptPad and informing them whether they need to update (or even if they can *optionally* update). Since this seemed like a solvable problem, we tried creating an experimental implementatiton of ServiceWorkers in CryptPad, and then the fun started...\n\n### ServiceWorkers in Firefox\nSince Firefox 48, Firefox has begun following Chrome's model and running [different processes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox) for rendering the different tabs in the browser. However, this isolation has a side-effect that when you attempt to launch a ServiceWorker, it [may launch even though one already exists for the same website](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438945), because the other one exists in a different tab which happens to be operating in a different process. However, the postMessage() requests from tabs go out to all of the ServiceWorkers so this bug can be worked around.\n\nUnfortunately we encountered some more issues with Firefox which we found not worth debugging. Our CryptDrive is a Javascript object which is represented in the encrypted realtime document as JSON and there is an ES6 [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) object in order to allow every change to the drive to be propagated to the underlying realtime object. In Firefox the proxy did not work when used in a ServiceWorker and at times our ServiceWorker simply stopped running.\n\n### Reporting bugs in browsers\nOne might think these are great opportunities to report issues with Firefox, and when we find an [issue which we think will affect lots of people](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1434278) especially if it is a regression, we don't hesitate to report it, but usually it is not clear how to reproduce the issue, whether there might be some error in our usage of the API which is being smoothed over by Chrome, or whether the component being reported on is a priority, in that case rather rain low quality bug reports down upon the poor browser developers, we spend our limited time trying to make CryptPad better. In the case of ServiceWorker in Firefox, our conclusion is that in effect the technology remains experimental and shouldn't be relied upon.\n\n## SharedWorker to the rescue\nFortunately there is another technology called [SharedWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SharedWorker) which is essentially identical to a plain vanilla WebWorker but can communicate with all tabs which are navigated to the site. Unfortunately this technology is only supported in [Chrome and Firefox](https://caniuse.com/#feat=sharedworkers), but the support for this technology, we found, really works!\n\nHowever, Firefox still has the [issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438945) with of multiple SharedWorkers being created for multiple tabs, but since this issue is fixable we were able to go ahead with it anyway. For browsers which have no SharedWorker, they would fallback to plain old WebWorker. Though this seems like it would be a problem, it is in fact quite fine because actions done in the drive by another WebWorker are the same as actions done in the drive by another device, they need to be encrypted and sent to the server in order to persist anyway.\n\n## Faster CryptPad\nComing in the release on Tuesday June 26, 2018, we will have a new SharedWorker based CryptPad instance, that means when you use Chrome or Firefox, the first time you open CryptPad, it will load your drive, but then every tab you open after that will communicate with the SharedWorker managing the drive and therefore pads will load nearly twice as fast.","source":"_posts/Faster-loads-with-SharedWorker-ServiceWorker.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Faster loads with SharedWorker & ServiceWorker\ndate: 2018-06-22 21:21:58\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - WebWorker\n  - SharedWorker\n  - Performance\n---\n\nWhen CryptPad was first created, the only thing to load was the CryptPad code itself and the pad which you were editing.

Recently edited pads were remembered in the browser’s <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\">localStorage</a> which was not portable between computers but allowed some recent history to be kept.</p>\n<p>However, we wanted to allow people to login and manage their pads on all of their devices so we created the CryptDrive. Anyone who has used CryptPad but never logged in is encouraged to <a href=\"https://cryptpad.fr/register\">register and login</a> (it’s free) and check out their drive. CryptDrive is basically just a realtime pad containing a JSON structure with links to all of your pads as well as their titles and other information. When you update the title of a pad, it changes the pad itself but it also changes your drive so that you can see the title of the pad in your drive. This is of course not perfect because if someone else changes the title of a pad, your drive will not be updated until you look at the pad again, but doing everything with the server completely blind to the content isn’t easy, and this works reasonably well.</p>\n<p>However, CryptDrive causes an additional delay when loading CryptPad because whenever you load a document, you are actually loading two realtime instances. Since the drive is loaded over and over for every pad you view, it was obvious to us that we could make it more efficient using communication inside the browser.</p>\n<h2 id=\"First-idea-Messages-between-tabs\"><a href=\"#First-idea-Messages-between-tabs\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"First idea: Messages between tabs\"></a>First idea: Messages between tabs</h2><p>Tabs (or windows) in a browser which are on the same website are able to <a href=\"http://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/Using-Local-Storage-as-a-communication-channel\">communicate using localStorage</a> and so it seemed like a good solution to just have one tab claim the role of managing the drive and then when another tab is opened, it would message the first. However, this seemingly easy solution becomes a nightmare when you consider what happens when that tab is closed. The drive that everyone is relying on goes away and all of the other tabs are without a drive so they need to <a href=\"https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html\">flip a coin</a> to decide which tab should become the keeper of the drive, then that tab needs to download the drive before it can service events, all the while any of the buttons which affect the drive (for instance deleting the pad) cannot possibly function. This idea was soon scrapped…</p>\n<h2 id=\"Enter-ServiceWorker\"><a href=\"#Enter-ServiceWorker\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Enter ServiceWorker\"></a>Enter ServiceWorker</h2><p>Recently, the HTML5 working group created a new standard called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorker\">ServiceWorker</a> which for someone making a webapp seems like a dream come true. ServiceWorkers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are side-processes which are created one-per-website and live in the background.</li>\n<li>Can intercept HTTP requests from your main javascript (excellent for caching!).</li>\n<li>Is suspended when the last tab is closed, and re-launched when the user returns.</li>\n<li>Are stored in suspended state even when the browser is turned off.</li>\n<li>Supported by <a href=\"https://caniuse.com/#search=serviceworker\">every modern browser</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the website loads a worker, if the worker is already running it will not load and will instead defer to the existing worker. Communicating between workers and tabs which are on the website is possible via a <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Client/postMessage\">postMessage()</a> API and then the ServiceWorker can postMessage() which will reach all tabs that are navigated to the website.</p>\n<p>One limitation of this design is versioning. Because the ServiceWorker would stay alive potentially forever, we needed to identify a way to upgrade it if a new version of CryptPad is released. This is quite important for CryptPad as version mismatches can lead to catastrophic conflicts between different browsers working on the same document.</p>\n<p>Though updating is non-trivial, we were able to solve it by sending version messages between different components of CryptPad and informing them whether they need to update (or even if they can <em>optionally</em> update). Since this seemed like a solvable problem, we tried creating an experimental implementatiton of ServiceWorkers in CryptPad, and then the fun started…</p>\n<h3 id=\"ServiceWorkers-in-Firefox\"><a href=\"#ServiceWorkers-in-Firefox\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"ServiceWorkers in Firefox\"></a>ServiceWorkers in Firefox</h3><p>Since Firefox 48, Firefox has begun following Chrome’s model and running <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox\">different processes</a> for rendering the different tabs in the browser. However, this isolation has a side-effect that when you attempt to launch a ServiceWorker, it <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1438945\">may launch even though one already exists for the same website</a>, because the other one exists in a different tab which happens to be operating in a different process. However, the postMessage() requests from tabs go out to all of the ServiceWorkers so this bug can be worked around.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately we encountered some more issues with Firefox which we found not worth debugging. Our CryptDrive is a Javascript object which is represented in the encrypted realtime document as JSON and there is an ES6 <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy\">Proxy</a> object in order to allow every change to the drive to be propagated to the underlying realtime object.

biweekly releases","date":"2018-02-23T13:37:15.000Z","author":"Aaron MacSween","_content":"\nApproximately one year ago, we published an article about our intention to follow a [biweekly release schedule](/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/).\nSince then, we've thought of every second Tuesday as _release day_.\nStarting with [the letter A](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.0.0) on February 21st, 2017 and ending with [the letter Z](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.25.0) on January 30th, 2018, we went through the whole latin alphabet.\n\nThroughout this self-imposed regimen, we managed to meet each deadline, though on occasion we had to stay at the office later than usual.\nAny time a release was more difficult than expected, we considered what went wrong and added a counter-measure to our release checklist (in CryptPad, naturally).\nEach release became easier than the one before, but even so, we found there were some drawbacks to this rigid schedule.\n\n## Changing our pace\n\nHaving a regular rhythm for our releases trained us to break up complex features into components that could be implemented within a two week period.\nWith that in mind, not all tasks fit neatly within two weeks, and those larger tasks have had a tendency to get pushed to the next release.\nSo, now that we've finished one full year of releases, we've started to look more closely at those larger features which we've inadvertently neglected.\nThe tendency to procrastinate on especially difficult features is just another challenge to approach, but it's been one which is somewhat more difficult to summarize within a _to do_ list.\n\nAs of CryptPad v1.26.0, we're no longer following the strict biweekly schedule.\nTo be clear, this doesn't mean we're slowing down development.\nWe're still _working on CryptPad consistently_.\nWe still plan to _deliver features to users_ as soon as they are stable.\nWe still plan to _deploy on Tuesdays_, since it's as early in the week as possible without falling on a Monday and deploying on a Friday is a _terrible idea_.\n\n<img src=\"/images/iamdevloper_deploy_on_friday.jpeg\" alt=\"Should I release on a Friday?\" style=\"width:50%;\" />\n\nSome releases might happen in a single week.\nOthers might take stretch to three weeks or a full month, but we'll do our best not to take any longer than that.\nWe try to be as transparent as possible with our plans, and so users should expect each release to also specify the projected date for the following release.\n\n## What's coming next...\n\nIn the last year, we tried to find a balance between improving user security through the use of our [sandboxing techniques](2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/), and implementing the productivity features necessary for people to consider the security improvements an _added bonus_ rather than an impractical ideology.\nThe core of our philosophy is that _security_ and _ease of use_ must be packaged together in order for tools like CryptPad to benefit users.\n\nWhile CryptPad is considerably more than a _proof-of-concept_, we don't consider it anywhere close to being finished.\nAs heavy users of CryptPad ourselves, we are aware of its rough edges.\nOur community has been very supportive with our continued development, though, so we're excited to be able to improve the following areas!\n\n### Sharing\n\nWe spend a lot of time passing links between each other when collaborating on a project.\nIn order to do so _privately_, the sender and the receiver must both use an encrypted messenger, or else the message could be intercepted by a malicious third-party.\nThe necessity of having to use a second tool makes it so that CryptPad must always be used as _part of the solution_, rather than solving a user's problem outright.\n\nWe'd like to approach this problem with two improvements:\n\n1. integrate our existing encrypted messenger better with the rest of CryptPad's functionality (as per [this issue](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/79))\n2. develop a method of sharing entire folder structures from a users drive, so that sharing can scale to support large-scale projects, a feature we call _Workgroups_\n\n### Layered protection\n\nEven if the link for a pad is shared securely, there is the possibility that somebody discovers that link through other (possibly malicious) means.\nWe're interested in developing CryptPad's basic two-tier permission system (edit/view) to address such concerns.\nThis could be accomplished in very different ways:\n\n* add the ability to protect a pad with a password, so that anyone who finds the link must also know a secret value in order to retrieve the pad's history from the server\n* add the ability to encrypt messages such that only a designated set of users can decrypt them using public-key cryptography\n\nSo far CryptPad only features a very limited set of cryptographic techniques.\nGoing forward, we hope to find ways to implement a more granular permission system which does not rely on the server behaving correctly.\nSome of these features are more in the realm of _applied-cryptography research_ than _web application development_, so it's very likely they'll be implemented later, but we're excited about them nevertheless.\n\n### Increased trustworthiness\n\nEven though CryptPad performs its encryption in your browser, there is always the possibility that a compromised server could send malicious code to the browser which would cause it to reveal its secrets.\nWe're interested in developing features which would mitigate these kinds of attacks against users, through a combination of modern browser features like [sub-resource integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity), and perhaps a registry of verified code signatures signed by us, the developers.\n\nIt's very difficult to make a web application secure against those responsible for delivering its source to your browser.\nWe're actively searching for any kind of technique for securing that makes CryptPad a more robust platform for storing your data privately, even against ourselves.\n\n### Password usability\n\nCryptPad's login system looks quite conventional at first glance, since it has a field for a _user-name_ and _password_ like most other web applications.\nUnlike those other applications, we never learn your user-name and password.\nInstead, your browser uses those fields to generate a unique secret value which you use to encrypt your drive, and accomplish a range of other tasks.\nThe downside of this approach is that if a user forgets their username or password, we can't help them gain access to their documents.\nIf we could, we'd be able to access their documents ourselves.\n\nFortunately, we're not the only team building web applications that use cryptography, and so there has been some research into how to improve password-based workflows without revealing secrets data to the server's host (us).\nWe've already received emails from users who've inadvertently locked themselves out of their accounts with no way to recover their data, and that's a situation we'd like to help people avoid, so this is a feature we're looking forward to offering.\n\n### More applications\n\nLots of users have requested that we add a few more applications to CryptPad, and we've been listening!\nWe plan to add support for spreadsheets, and possibly other applications so that people don't have to fall back to using an unencrypted CryptPad alternative.\n\n### Scalability\n\nOne advantage CryptPad has over other conventional collaboration platforms is that a lot of the difficult computation is run in the users' browsers, rather than on our server.\nThis means that we can support a very large number of clients without a noticeable decrease in performance.\nEven so, the number of people using _CryptPad.fr_ and the amount they use it has increased dramatically.\n\nThough excessive popularity is a wonderful problem to have, we'd like to avoid a situation where users have difficulty accessing our service, so improved scalability is something we'd like to work on.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe haven't yet decided how long we intend for this release cycle to last, and we don't have a set list of the exact goals we'd like to accomplish.\nWe're taking a step back to decide where we'd like to go next.\n\nWe recognize that CryptPad's growth over the last year was driven largely by word of mouth between friends and colleagues who care about privacy.\nBy moving towards a more flexible schedule, we hope to make it easier to adapt to the frequent feedback we receive from people using CryptPad to help them accomplish a multitude of goals.\n\nWe're very interested in hearing what you think about this change.\nFeel free to reach out to us through any of the methods listed on [our contact

id=\"Sharing\"><a href=\"#Sharing\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Sharing\"></a>Sharing</h3><p>We spend a lot of time passing links between each other when collaborating on a project.\nIn order to do so <em>privately</em>, the sender and the receiver must both use an encrypted messenger, or else the message could be intercepted by a malicious third-party.\nThe necessity of having to use a second tool makes it so that CryptPad must always be used as <em>part of the solution</em>, rather than solving a user’s problem outright.</p>\n<p>We’d like to approach this problem with two improvements:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>integrate our existing encrypted messenger better with the rest of CryptPad’s functionality (as per <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/issues/79\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">this issue</a>)</li>\n<li>develop a method of sharing entire folder structures from a users drive, so that sharing can scale to support large-scale projects, a

the link for a pad is shared securely, there is the possibility that somebody discovers that link through other (possibly malicious) means.\nWe’re interested in developing CryptPad’s basic two-tier permission system (edit/view) to address such concerns.\nThis could be accomplished in very different ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add the ability to protect a pad with a password, so that anyone who finds the link must also know a secret value in order to retrieve the pad’s history from the server</li>\n<li>add the ability to encrypt messages such that only a designated set of users can decrypt them using public-key cryptography</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So far CryptPad only features a very limited set of cryptographic techniques.\nGoing forward, we hope to find ways to implement a more granular permission system which does not rely on the server behaving correctly.\nSome of these features are more in the realm of <em>applied-cryptography research</em> than <em>web application development</em>, so it’s very likely they’ll be implemented later, but we’re excited about them nevertheless.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Increased-trustworthiness\"><a href=\"#Increased-trustworthiness\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Increased trustworthiness\"></a>Increased trustworthiness</h3><p>Even though CryptPad performs its encryption in your browser, there is always the possibility that a compromised server could send malicious code to the browser which would cause it to reveal its secrets.\nWe’re interested in developing features which would mitigate these kinds of attacks against users, through a combination of modern browser features like <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"external\">sub-resource integrity</a>, and perhaps a registry of verified code signatures signed by us, the developers.</p>\n<p>It’s very difficult to make a web application secure against those responsible for delivering its source to your browser.\nWe’re actively searching for any kind of technique for securing that makes CryptPad a more robust platform for storing your data privately, even against ourselves.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Password-usability\"><a href=\"#Password-usability\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Password usability\"></a>Password usability</h3><p>CryptPad’s login system looks quite conventional at first glance, since it has a field for a <em>user-name</em> and <em>password</em> like most other web applications.\nUnlike those other applications, we never learn your user-name and password.\nInstead, your browser uses those fields to generate a unique secret value which you use to encrypt your drive, and accomplish a range of other tasks.\nThe downside of this approach is that if a user forgets their username or password, we can’t help them gain access to their documents.\nIf we could, we’d be able to access their documents ourselves.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we’re not the only team building web applications that use cryptography, and so there has been some research into how to improve password-based workflows without revealing secrets data to the server’s host (us).\nWe’ve already received emails from users who’ve inadvertently locked themselves out of their accounts with no way to recover their data, and that’s a situation we’d like to help people avoid, so this is a feature we’re looking forward to offering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"More-applications\"><a href=\"#More-applications\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"More applications\"></a>More applications</h3><p>Lots of users have requested that we add a few more applications to CryptPad, and we’ve been listening!\nWe plan to add support for spreadsheets, and possibly other applications so that people don’t have to fall back to using an unencrypted CryptPad alternative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Scalability\"><a href=\"#Scalability\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Scalability\"></a>Scalability</h3><p>One advantage CryptPad has over other conventional collaboration platforms is that a lot of the difficult computation is run in the users’ browsers, rather than on our server.\nThis means that we can support a very large number of clients without a noticeable decrease in performance.\nEven so, the number of people using <em>CryptPad.fr</em> and the amount they use it has increased dramatically.</p>\n<p>Though excessive popularity is a wonderful problem to have, we’d like to avoid a situation where users have difficulty accessing our service, so improved scalability is something we’d like to work on.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Conclusion\"><a

goals we’d like to accomplish.\nWe’re taking a step back to decide where we’d like to go next.</p>\n<p>We recognize that CryptPad’s growth over the last year was driven largely by word of mouth between friends and colleagues who care about privacy.\nBy moving towards a more flexible schedule, we hope to make it easier to adapt to the frequent feedback we receive from people using CryptPad to help them accomplish a multitude of goals.</p>\n<p>We’re very interested in hearing what you think about this change.\nFeel free to reach out to us through any of the methods listed on <a

intention to follow a <a href=\"/2017/02/24/Announcing-biweekly-releases/\">biweekly release schedule</a>.\nSince then, we’ve thought of every second Tuesday as <em>release day</em>.\nStarting with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.0.0\">the letter A</a> on February 21st, 2017 and ending with <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.25.0\">the letter Z</a> on January 30th, 2018, we went through the whole latin alphabet.</p>\n<p>Throughout this self-imposed regimen, we managed to meet each deadline, though on occasion we had to stay at the office later than usual.\nAny time a release was more difficult than expected, we considered what went wrong and added a counter-measure to our release checklist (in CryptPad, naturally).\nEach release became easier than the one before, but even so, we found there were some drawbacks to this rigid schedule.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Changing-our-pace\"><a href=\"#Changing-our-pace\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Changing our pace\"></a>Changing our pace</h2><p>Having a regular rhythm for our releases trained us to break up complex features into components that could be implemented within a two week period.\nWith that in mind, not all tasks fit neatly within two weeks, and those larger tasks have had a tendency to get pushed to the next release.\nSo, now that we’ve finished one full year of releases, we’ve started to look more closely at those larger features which we’ve inadvertently neglected.\nThe tendency to procrastinate on especially difficult features is just another challenge to approach, but it’s been one which is somewhat more difficult to summarize within a <em>to do</em> list.</p>\n<p>As of CryptPad v1.26.0, we’re no longer following the strict biweekly schedule.\nTo be clear, this doesn’t mean we’re slowing down development.\nWe’re still <em>working on CryptPad consistently</em>.\nWe still plan to <em>deliver features to users</em> as soon as they are stable.\nWe still plan to <em>deploy on Tuesdays</em>, since it’s as early in the week as possible without falling on a Monday and deploying on a Friday is a <em>terrible idea</em>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/iamdevloper_deploy_on_friday.jpeg\" alt=\"Should I release on a Friday?\" style=\"width:50%;\" /></p>\n<p>Some releases might happen in a single week.\nOthers might take stretch to three

and found multiple XSS vulnerabilities</li>\n<li>We learned things and improved our security in multiple ways and we have plans to build even further improvements</li>\n<li>Update all the things</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Exactly-what-happened\"><a href=\"#Exactly-what-happened\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Exactly what happened\"></a>Exactly what happened</h2><p>Late Tuesday night after work, I got an email from Martin Gubri telling me that he had found multiple XSS vulnerabilities in CryptPad.\nThis is not fun news for anybody, but as the browser stores encryption keys, it is especially bad news.\nI want to reiterate what I said in <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/02/20/Time-to-Encrypt-the-Cloud/\" title=\"Time to Encrypt the Cloud\">our first blog post</a>, CryptPad is just a regular web app but with provable ethics, it is not designed to provide military grade security.</p>\n<p>Though we could have waited until our next release to fix this issue, we decided that we could not feel good working on new features while knowing about an issue which could harm our users.\nHowever, we wanted to fix the systemic issue which caused XSS to be possible in the first place, not just the symptoms which we became aware of.</p>\n<p>CryptPad uses a modern web feature called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Security_Policy\">Content Security Policy</a> to prevent attacks such as this one.\nContent Security Policy allows a web server to mandate that javascript can only be loaded from domains which are explicitly authorized.\nUnfortunately, CKEditor <a href=\"https://dev.ckeditor.com/ticket/8584\">makes heavy usage of inline scripts</a> (scripts which are written directly into the HTML file), so we had made an exception for inline script which represents the most common type of XSS.\nWhen Martin did a review of our application, he found multiple places where we had not been properly escaping HTML content and sadly all of these were attackable despite our Content Security Policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"How-we-reacted\"><a href=\"#How-we-reacted\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How we reacted\"></a>How we reacted</h2><p>For me, a security bug does not come alone, it is always the result of multiple failures at different levels.\nZero Knowledge is about resilient software for resilient society and we allowed ourselves to rely entirely on proper escaping.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, March 6th, 2017, we deployed and released a set of patches to our previous <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.0\">Bunyip release</a>, which we’re calling <a href=\"https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/releases/tag/1.1.1\">1.1.1 <em>Bunyip’s Revenge</em></a>.\nThis not only sanitizes XSS in places where we know about but it also implements a strong Content Security Policy everywhere except inside of the CKEditor iframe, which insists on injecting script tags.</p>\n<p>It is important to upgrade as soon as possible because XSS attacks can potentially give an adversary access to all of your pads.\nIf you’re using cryptpad.fr on the website then there’s nothing you need to do, everything is fixed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Moving-forward\"><a href=\"#Moving-forward\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Moving forward\"></a>Moving forward</h2><p>We want to find and pioneer better ways of protecting your data on CryptPad.\nWe also hope to foster a whole movement of Zero Knowledge web services which feature layered security, protecting users from external threats as well as the mistakes that developers are sure to make.</p>\n<p>Spurred on by the revelation of our own errors, we have reinvigorated a conversation about moving each of the <em>apps</em> such as CKEditor into a <a href=\"https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/sandboxed-iframes/\">sandboxed iframe</a> where they would be unable to access any of the cryptographic keys or other pads.\nThis introduces some difficulty on our end, as we want to provide a resilient platform while making Zero Knowledge an approachable subject for web developers.</p>\n<p>Finally I would like to also publically thank our friend <a href=\"https://github.com/kpcyrd\"><em>kpcyrd</em></a> for finding another XSS issue back in early December of 2016, before we had official releases or a blog where we could give him credit

cryptography should be invisible. In order to do this, we made use of the web-app model so people could just go to cryptpad.fr and immediately begin using the app, no installation necessary. However, this model has a known flaw, the server can decide what client-side code it will send to any given user, allowing a compromized server to serve code with a back-door vulnerability.\n\nRecently, I did an experiment to make CryptPad more secure against these types of attacks by signing the code. CryptPad is a unique webapp, even without considering the encryption aspect. There is no build system, the code we write is exactly the same as what your web browser runs. All of the CryptPad html, javascript and resources are static files which are served by a plain old web server. The data persistance is managed by an API server which the web browser communicates with using an HTML5 WebSocket. Finally, in order to add a layer of security against possible Cross Site Scripting attacks, CryptPad makes use of a [cross domain iframe](https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/), protecting your encryption keys from the majority of the CryptPad code in the same way that your online bank is protected from that sketchy porn site open in another tab.\n\nSince CryptPad has no build system, there are many small javascript files which must be loaded. To do this, CryptPad uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/). While many small files are generally considered to be bad for website performance, RequireJS uses the HTML5 [async attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) to tell the browser not to block loading of other things while waiting for the scripts to load. Secondly, RequireJS also allows version numbers to be added to the script URLs which allows us to cache almost everything in the browser. Finally, we use the [HTTP/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2) protocol to serve resources because it allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time, while HTTP/2 is incompatible with WebSocket, this is ok because the web-app is served from a different server from the API server.\n\n## Chain of Trust\n\nJust one corrupted script is enough to render the security of an entire web-app useless, so in CryptPad we needed the signing to cover all javascript files. Fortunately there is a new HTML5 technology called [Subresource Integrity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity) which allows putting the hash of a script in a script tag attribute and makes the browser verify the script before executing it.\n\nInsecure, some.website can serve you anything:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSecure, only one possible script can be sent by some.website or else the web browser will throw an error and refuse to run the script:\n\n```\n<script\n  src=\"https://some.website/path/to/script.js\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-G1KwaJYUEDsA1SD/6Wt4z0laskKzIwgqgs5cYH0CW/o=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nSo rather than signing every script, I only needed to make a list of hashes of every script, and sign that. What I needed was a way to generate a *manifest*, and so I developed a small program which could hash all of the javascript files in CryptPad and generate a manifest file. The content of the manifest looks something like this:\n\n```\n\"files\": {\n  \"assert\": {\n    \"frame\": {\n      \"frame.js\": \"BrN2JNnK4QJCztw3PyRRPAsEwSq5lczTBrRkzdLAFow=\",\n      \"respond.js\": \"yO0KFMHiCdE1fXFWPVaFB+Mmh37OCl/UNPpXrYtWF7A=\"\n    },\n    \"main.js\": \"ABf3uhmYVHWaHX6vhK8K2jAUY8XqRjjMJ2FqXVGLZE0=\",\n    \"translations\": {\n      \"main.js\": \"50Ami2eghyXcGKGYTaDK1vUeEuAEG7kcpvUoCKbUaUU=\"\n```\n\nIt contains a JSON tree which mirrors the files that are part of the CryptPad codebase and the hashes of the files for the Subresource Integrity check. Once the `manifest.js` file was created, then I needed a javascript file which would load and verify it. Since the manifest is different every time a new release is made, the verification of the manifest needed to be via *signing*. The manifest hash was signed along with a version number and those were placed in a file called `version.txt` and `version.txt` is loaded using a file called `sboot.js`. The hash of `sboot.js` was included directly into the html files which are cached, so `sboot.js` can never be changed at all.\n\n## Loading process\n\n### index.html\nFirst, the browser loads the html file, the html file contains a single script tag loading `sboot.js`\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  data-bootload=\"/customize/template.js\"\n  src=\"/common/sboot.js?ver=8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk%2B%2BVQ%2BBk83mRdXx4dK%2BXvSNPcI%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-8IaxCUqjpzoP7AEPEk++VQ+Bk83mRdXx4dK+XvSNPcI=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nThere is a custom attribute called `data-bootload` which indicates which javascript file should be loaded for that `html` file.\n\n### sboot.js\n\nWhen `sboot.js` gets loaded, it downloads and then verifies `version.txt` which is a signed message containing the CryptPad version number and the hash of `manifest.js`. The content that is signed looks something like this:\n\n```\n[85,\"h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"]\n```\n\nThe version number (85) is not the CryptPad version but rather an auto-incrementing number which is stored in the browser localStorage and prevents the server from downgrading the version of CryptPad. After the signature/version check completes successfully, `sboot.js` loads `manifest.js` like the following:\n\n```\n<script\n  async\n  src=\"/customize/manifest.js?ver=h%2BtOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy%2BgoBwNEELZk%3D\"\n  integrity=\"sha256-h+tOXVmYBWMmiVDylXvnRq28LWRVs6xy+goBwNEELZk=\"\n></script>\n```\n\nYou will notice that the hash is used also in the URL of `manifest.js`, this allows the server to signal that the files are immutable and can be cached by the browser forever which makes CryptPad load faster next time.\n\nAfter `manifest.js` loads, `sboot.js` finds the hash of `require.js` in the manifest and then manually loads `require.js` in the same way. Once `require.js` is loaded, `sboot.js` configures require to use the hashes from the manifest for every file it loads, then it uses require to load `boot2.js`.\n\n### boot2.js\n\nThis file is not needed for security, but unlike `sboot.js`, it can easily be changed from release to release and it contains any code which should be run before the main CryptPad code. Things such as additional requirejs configuration and shims for missing browser APIs are placed here. After `boot2.js` is complete, it reads the `data-bootload` attribute from the html file and invokes require to load that.\n\n## Further development\n\nWhile this system provides excellent security, it is still not perfect. If the root html file is compromized then it can alter the chain of trust, or scrap it completely. With a very long cache header, the browser will store the html file essentially forever, but if the user triggers a hard reload with the F5 key, then the cache will be flushed.\n\nThe root html file can be signed using pgp and then verified using the [signed pages](https://github.com/tasn/webext-signed-pages) chrome extension. But signed pages is not able to prevent the loading of the website even if the signature is invalid and it only takes 1 second for the keys in localStorage to be leaked.\n\nIf the root html file was *generated* by the server each load, it could contain a secret key which is used to encrypt the keys in the localStorage, thus rendering them unusable if the html file is re-loaded, and meaning that the user must re-enter their password and would then be able to see that the signature on the html file is invalid, however unless signed pages can ignore the key inside of the html file when verifying the signature, it would have to be re-signed every time, pushing the pgp key onto the server, which we are worried about being compromized.\n\nThere are also a number of configuration files in the CryptPad project which are in fact javascript files and would thus be signed by the release manager, preventing anyone hosting CryptPad from changing them so it may be a long time before this project is merged into CryptPad mainline, however it is available and you can experiment with it by checking out the [code-integrity](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/tree/code-integrity) branch of the CryptPad project.","source":"_posts/Signing-CryptPad.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Signing CryptPad\ndate: 2018-06-15 12:07:05\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - signing\n  - subresource integrity\n  - chain of trust\n---\n\nCryptPad was designed with a view that privacy should be default and cryptography should be invisible.

In order to do this, we made use of the web-app model so people could just go to cryptpad.fr and immediately begin using the app, no installation necessary. However, this model has a known flaw, the server can decide what client-side code it will send to any given user, allowing a compromized server to serve code with a back-door vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Recently, I did an experiment to make CryptPad more secure against these types of attacks by signing the code. CryptPad is a unique webapp, even without considering the encryption aspect. There is no build system, the code we write is exactly the same as what your web browser runs. All of the CryptPad html, javascript and resources are static files which are served by a plain old web server. The data persistance is managed by an API server which the web browser communicates with using an HTML5 WebSocket. Finally, in order to add a layer of security against possible Cross Site Scripting attacks, CryptPad makes use of a <a href=\"https://blog.cryptpad.fr/2017/08/30/CryptPad-s-new-Secure-Cross-Domain-Iframe/\">cross domain iframe</a>, protecting your encryption keys from the majority of the CryptPad code in the same way that your online bank is protected from that sketchy porn site open in another tab.</p>\n<p>Since CryptPad has no build system, there are many small javascript files which must be loaded. To do this, CryptPad uses <a href=\"http://requirejs.org/\">RequireJS</a>. While many small files are generally considered to be bad for website performance, RequireJS uses the HTML5 <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script\">async attribute</a> to tell the browser not to block loading of other things while waiting for the scripts to load. Secondly, RequireJS also allows version numbers to be added to the script URLs which allows us to cache almost everything in the browser. Finally, we use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2\">HTTP/2</a> protocol to serve resources because it allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time, while HTTP/2 is incompatible with WebSocket, this is ok because the web-app is served from a different server from the API server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Chain-of-Trust\"><a href=\"#Chain-of-Trust\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Chain of Trust\"></a>Chain of Trust</h2><p>Just one corrupted script is enough to render the security of an entire web-app useless, so in CryptPad we needed the signing to cover all javascript files. Fortunately there is a new HTML5 technology called <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity\">Subresource Integrity</a> which allows putting the hash of a script in a script tag attribute and makes the browser verify the script before executing it.</p>\n<p>Insecure, some.website can serve you anything:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;script</div><div class=\"line\">  src=&quot;https://some.website/path/to/script.js&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>Secure, only one possible script can be sent by some.website or else the web browser will throw an error and refuse to run the script:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&lt;script</div><div class=\"line\">  src=&quot;https://some.website/path/to/script.js&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">  integrity=&quot;sha256-G1KwaJYUEDsA1SD/6Wt4z0laskKzIwgqgs5cYH0CW/o=&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>So rather than signing every script, I only needed to make a list of hashes of every script, and sign that. What I needed was a way to generate a <em>manifest</em>, and so I developed a small program which could hash all of the javascript files in CryptPad and generate a manifest file. The content of the manifest looks something like this:</p>\n<figure class=\"highlight plain\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><div class=\"line\">1</div><div class=\"line\">2</div><div class=\"line\">3</div><div class=\"line\">4</div><div class=\"line\">5</div><div class=\"line\">6</div><div class=\"line\">7</div><div class=\"line\">8</div><div class=\"line\">9</div></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><div class=\"line\">&quot;files&quot;: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">  &quot;assert&quot;: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">    &quot;frame&quot;: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      &quot;frame.js&quot;: &quot;BrN2JNnK4QJCztw3PyRRPAsEwSq5lczTBrRkzdLAFow=&quot;,</div><div class=\"line\">      &quot;respond.js&quot;: &quot;yO0KFMHiCdE1fXFWPVaFB+Mmh37OCl/UNPpXrYtWF7A=&quot;</div><div class=\"line\">    &#125;,</div><div class=\"line\">    &quot;main.js&quot;: &quot;ABf3uhmYVHWaHX6vhK8K2jAUY8XqRjjMJ2FqXVGLZE0=&quot;,</div><div class=\"line\">    &quot;translations&quot;: &#123;</div><div class=\"line\">      &quot;main.js&quot;: &quot;50Ami2eghyXcGKGYTaDK1vUeEuAEG7kcpvUoCKbUaUU=&quot;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>\n<p>It contains a JSON tree which mirrors the files that are part of the CryptPad codebase and the hashes of the files for the Subresource Integrity check. Once the <code>manifest.js</code> file was created, then I needed a javascript file which would load and verify it. Since the manifest is different every time a new release is made, the verification of the manifest needed to be via <em>signing</em>. The manifest hash was signed along with a version number and those were placed in a file called <code>version.txt</code> and <code>version.txt</code> is loaded using a file called <code>sboot.js</code>.

Zero Knowledge has two meanings, it can refer to a *Zero Knowledge Proof*, an obscure mathematical construct with few real-world uses but it can also refer to something with a very real-world meaning: web services which encrypt your content so that they themselves cannot read it. You may be wondering how this can be secure when a web administrator can quietly change their site to an unencrypted version at any time. This is a real problem, there is currently no way to verify the content (and code) of a website, but we need not despair. Even though we cannot prove that a website is *secure*, we can check that they are promising to make themselves blind to your content and they make that promise knowing if break it they might get caught.\n\n## Security is probabilistic\n\nConsider the security software you use every day such as your web browser with HTTPS, your phone and your computer's operating system. Have you ever stopped to check that software for \"backdoors\" (intentionally inserted which break your security)? If you have then you are one of the tiny group of heroes who dedicate their time to making the world a bit more robust and I salute you for it. If you're like the rest of us, you just hope that the authors of that software were honest enough and protective enough of their reputations to avoid inserting a backdoor when it means potentially getting caught. Zero Knowledge is based on the same logic, just as software makers can surreptitiously add a backdoor to their software, Zero Knowledge websites can serve a backdoor to the user. However, just as software makers who insert backdoors in their software risk getting caught, Zero Knowledge web app providers who insert backdoors in their website also risk being caught.\n\n## The metadata question\n\nMetadata is a serious issue. Former CIA director Michael Hayden said of the agency: \"We kill people based on metadata\". I don't want to belittle the importance of data which is not the actual content, but at the same time we must recognize that there is a huge uphill climb fix this issue. While the CryptPad project tries not to collect metadata when it can be avoided, we also recognize that other cloud providers may collect more or less metadata than us in order to provide their services. Fundamentally, we accept that a service qualifies as Zero Knowledge as long as the *content* is protected from the server operators. We are committed to studying ways to develop new, more secure solutions to the metadata issue but the spirit of Zero Knowledge is about more ethical solutions which are immediately actionable.\n\n## How to know if a service is Zero Knowledge\n\nZero Knowledge is about trust, nobody can read over and verify all of the code of all of the Zero Knowledge services available, but there are some heuristics which you can use when choosing a service.\n\n### 1. Is it primarily Open Source ?\n\nServices which are primarily Open Source are easier to evaluate both for accidental security mistakes and for potentially nefarious behavior. Furthermore, when a company commits their software to Open Source they make a statement that they are in the business of being an ethical provider for the long term and are not just riding the wave of a popular term.\n\n### 2. Were you warned about losing your password ?\n\nTrue Zero Knowledge services must protect your data from themselves using something you know and they don't, such as your password... In the event that you lose your password and you are using a true Zero Knowledge service, your content will be inaccessible to you and to the service - the locks that keep them out will keep you out as well. Check for this warning.\n\n### 3. Does it claim to be Zero Knowledge or End-to-end Encrypted ?\n\nThis is perhaps the most important question, because when a service provider makes the public statement that they are Zero Knowledge, they show they are prepared to risk their reputation if they are discovered to be storing your content in a way they can access. Some Zero Knowledge providers prefer the term *End-to-end Encrypted* which has gained significant popularity with messaging apps. There is no functional difference between a Zero Knowledge application and one which advertizes End-to-end Encryption.\n\n## Talk to us\n\nCryptPad is developed by a team of 3 people with generous financing from BPIFrance through the [OpenPaaS::NG Research Project](http://ng.open-paas.org/about-us.html). Our mission is to make Cloud Computing more ethical by promoting Zero Knowledge Cloud Services and show young entrepreneurs that it is possible to make a living while being ethical with peoples' data.

There are four\ntypes of information:\n\n* What we can't know: This is data that CryptPad app encrypts so we will never have\naccess to it\n* What we must see but don't collect: This is information which we don't bother\nto store but because of how the technology works, we necessarily have access to it.\n* What we must know: This is metadata which we cannot help but see because of the\nway the technology works\n* What we want to know: This is information which we really want to know in order\nto make CryptPad better every day\n\nWe want to know everything about *people*, we want to know how *people* use CryptPad,\nwhy *people* use CryptPad and how we can make their experience easier. However, we\ndon't want to know anything at all about *you*.\n\nThis poses a challenge because we want to collect as much aggregate information as we\ncan in order to make a great web service, but we don't want to collect data that can\nbe *linked* in order to tell a story about you.\n\n## What we can't know\n\nThere are a few things which the Zero Knowledge design of CryptPad does not allow\nus to know at all. These include (obviously) your password and the content of your\npads, but less obviously, the titles of your pads, the names of the contributors and\nyour username (you can even have the same username as someone else on the system, we\nwon't know). The types of your pads are also unknown to us though we could make\neducated guesses by looking at the encrypted data.\n\n*It is our promise to you that we will never collect this information.*\n\n## What we could know but don't bother to collect\n\nThere are also some things which we don't really want to know but we cannot avoid\nseeing it anyway. This includes most importantly the IP addresses of people who\nedited a specific pad. Technically we know your\n[IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) because it's how you\ncommunicate with our server, but most of the actual operations are done using\ncommands sent down a [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).\nOnce the WebSocket is established, we assign you a random ID and this is how\nyou are referenced, what appears in our server logs looks like this:\n\n```\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:20:47:45 +0200] \"GET /pad/ HTTP/1.1\"\n304 0 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36\n(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109 Safari/537.36\" \"-\"\n```\n\nNotice there is no pad ID in there, the pad ID is not in the URL so it doesn't go\nin the server logs by default.\n\nCompare this with EtherPad:\n\n```\n  IP Address                                             Pad ID\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:11:54:37 -0700] \"GET /p/UNWnpczTkq HTTP/1.1\"\n200 8920 \"https://pad.meshwith.me/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X\n10_10_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109\nSafari/537.36\"\n```\n\n*You cannot verify that we're not collecting this so best assume that we are.*\n\n## What we must know\n\nThere are some things which we need to know in order for CryptPad to function\nproperly, we need to know which pads are in your drive in order to impose\nstorage limits on logged-in users and to expire pads which nobody cares about.\nHowever, we don't know much about who you are. Since we don't know your username,\nto us you are identified by a public signing key, something like this:\n\n`YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A`\n\nWe know that `YIBzjPr3beuGgfHNglGfo3xq-dquxsj4Bst-ze7mL9A` has 392 MB of data in\ntheir CryptDrive including a pad of some type which has the ID\n`fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390` and an uploaded which we know as\n`ff2fdf9bb99ecc89d29d780780de10efdac14ed15e93b235`. One of these pads that they\nhave is actually their drive itself, but we don't strictly know which one (again,\nwe can take guesses based on the size of the patches). You can find out what your\nsigning key is by looking at in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings).\n\nWe also know when each pad was last accessed so that we can know to delete pads\nwhich are not in anybody's CryptDrive and have not been opened in a long time.\n\n### Why we can't avoid collecting IP addresses\n\nBeing able to know how many *different* people are using CryptPad is very important\nto us. One rather rude person decided to try to crash our server by creating 647,533\npads. They didn't put much thought into their attack because what they were doing\nwas not actually creating pads, but it illustrates the problem that if we don't\nknow how many *different* people are using the server, we don't have any idea\nwhether we are popular or under attack. Worse, we don't know what features have\nwidespread support vs. which ones are only popular with a few prolific users.\n\nOne obvious thought is to simply run the IP addresses through a hash function the\nway we traditionally hash passwords. However this sadly cannot work because there\nare only 4.2 billion IPv4 addresses and constructing a\n[rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) to get back the\noriginal IP addresses would take only about 1 day of computer time. So in the end\nwe simply log the IP addresses and don't worry about it.\n\n### What a pad looks like to us\n\nA pad is stored as a file which represents a sequence of encrypted *patches*.\nThese patches change the content of the pad from nothing to whatever it becomes in\nthe end. A typical message looks something like this:\n```\n[0,\"69d46337f826c0ecd881be59c119a527\",\"MSG\",\"fe382219b10c0396de63d2bab7942390\",\"51Q....\"]\n```\nIt starts with a zero and then your temporary random ID, then it contains the word\nMSG and the ID of the pad which it is sent to, this format is exactly the same as\nwhat is sent on the wire. Finally it contains the encrypted patch which tells us\nessentially nothing except it gives us a rough idea of just how big the change was.\n\nOccasionally the client will send a *checkpoint*, this is a special patch which\nremoves all of the content and then puts it all back again. To us, a checkpoint\nlooks the same as anything else, it is a big ball of encrypted data, except in this\ncase it is flagged as a checkpoint so the server knows it can send only part of\nthe history of the pad instead of all of it. However, they do give us a good idea\nof how big the pad actually is at that time.\n\n## What we collect because we want to know\n\nWhat we really want to understand is your *experience* with CryptPad and how we can\nmake that experience better. So therefore we collect quite a number of data-points\nabout where people click and what their browser supports. For example we collect\nthe dimensions of your browser. Not because we want to know who you are but because\nwe want to know that types of browsers we need to support.\n\n```\n198.167.222.70 - - [06/Jul/2017:21:26:15 +0200]\n\"HEAD /common/feedback.html?DIMENSIONS:752x1440=1499369175085 HTTP/1.1\" 200 0\n\"https://cryptpad.fr/settings/\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_10_5)\nAppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/59.0.3071.109 Safari/537.36\" \"-\"\n```\n\nYou can see an exhaustive list of things that we collect by checking out the\n[feedback functionality](https://github.com/xwiki-labs/cryptpad/search?p=2&q=Cryptpad.feedback&type=&utf8=%E2%9C%93) in the CryptPad source code but\nas of the time of this writing, we are collecting feedback about the following\nthings (usually we just collect the fact that an event occurred, not more).\n\n* Clicking \"upgrade account\"\n* Clicking \"support cryptpad\"\n* Presentation: clicking on \"print slides\"\n* Registering and logging in\n* Opening your recent pads as an anonymous user\n* Clicking any CKEditor button such as \"bold\" or \"italic\"\n* Displaying the drive as icons or as a list\n* Creating and using templates\n* Showing and hiding the userlist or CKEditor menu bar\n* Whether your browser is missing certain important features like\n[Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy),\n[isArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/isArray)\nor [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)\n* Which type of pad you are using\n* The dimensions of your browser window\n* When you have changed your display name\n* Whether you have migrated your CryptDrive from the legacy format\n\nIf you are worried about what we might do with this data, you can disable\nfeedback collection in your [settings page](https://cryptpad.fr/settings/). But\nkeep in mind that if you disable it we cannot help but know, because your IP\naddress will be in the tiny minority of addresses which access the site but don't\nsend feedback messages.\n\n## What we can learn from the data\n\n\n### 1. People mostly use CryptPad to make a plain old pad\nBut the code/markdown pad and the CryptDrive are catching up.\n![Unique IPs per pad type](/images/Analytics-padtypes.png)\n\n### 2. Activity has been on a very slow rise but with a few spikes\nThis chart shows unique IPs per day hitting CryptPad. You can things are relatively\nflat over time except for a big day in June and then some increased activity in July\nafter the UI improvements were rolled out.\n![Unique IPs per day](/images/Analytics-uniques.png)\n\n### 3. Browser window dimensions are all over the map\nThis chart shows bubbles which are bigger depending on how many different IPs\nreport the same browser window dimensions. Tragically it seems that there is no\nway to predict what aspect ratio a device using CryptPad is going to have.\n![Browser window dimensions](/images/Analytics-browserdimensions.png)\n\n### 4. Lots of pads are made and then abandoned\nThe first chart shows in blue the number of pads created each day and the number\nof pads which become \"abandoned\" (have not been touched in 2 weeks). This says\nthat perhaps pads are considered ephimeral and not to be used for the long term.\n![Created vs. abandoned pads](/images/Analytics-createdabandoned.png)\n\nHere we can see the evolution of pads which have been accessed within the last\nday the last week and the last month. There is slow but steady growth in the\npads active in the past month.\n![Number of active pads](/images/Analytics-activepads.png)\n\n### 5. People use CryptPad for a while, then leave\nWe measured 15,000 IP addresses which came to CryptPad just to look at one pad and\nthen left, but of the 13,000 who stayed longer than that we analyzed the time when\nthey first arrived and the time when they made their last visit. About 630 IP\naddressses have been continually using CryptPad for all 45 days.\n![Number of IPs continuing to access CryptPad](/images/Analytics-peopleleave.png)\nWe want to make CryptPad a useful tool for helping people get organized and make\ntheir projects succeed. So whenever people decide that CryptPad is not the right\nanswer for them, we care about what went wrong and how we can make it better.\n\n## How we analyze this data\n\nWe do all of our analysis ourselves, and we don't share any of this data with Google\nor other data companies. We're thankful to\n[Kibana/ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana) and\n[LogStash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash) for making it possible to do\nin depth analysis on our own computers without resorting to a cloud service.\n","source":"_posts/cryptpad-analytics-what-we-cant-know-what-we-must-know-what-we-want-to-know.md","raw":"---\ntitle: CryptPad Analytics & Privacy - What we can't know, what we must know, what we want to know\ndate: 2017-07-07 13:41:02\nauthor: Caleb James DeLisle\ntags:\n  - analytics\n  - data\n  - privacy\n---\n\nCryptPad is a Zero Knowledge cloud application, this means we have designed it such\nthat we do not have any access to the content which is hosted on our server.\nHowever, there are other things which we do collect and it is important that\nprivacy-minded users understand what we are collecting and why.

About 630 IP\naddressses have been continually using CryptPad for all 45 days.\n<img src=\"/images/Analytics-peopleleave.png\" alt=\"Number of IPs continuing to access CryptPad\">\nWe want to make CryptPad a useful tool for helping people get organized and make\ntheir projects succeed.
